harry potter and the sorcerer is stone chapter one the boy who lived mr eosstop and mrs eosstop dursley of number four privet drive were proud to say that they were perfectly normal thank you very much eosstop they were the last people you would expect to be involved in anything strange or mysterious because they just did not hold with such nonsense eosstop mr eosstop dursley was the director of a firm called grunnings which made drills eosstop he was a big beefy man with hardly any neck although he did have a very large mustache eosstop mrs eosstop dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice the usual amount of neck which came in very useful as she spent so much of her time craning over garden fences spying on the neighbors eosstop the dursleys had a small son called dudley and in their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere eosstop the dursleys had everything they wanted but they also had a secret and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it eosstop they did not think they could bear it if anyone found out about the potters eosstop mrs eosstop potter was mrs eosstop dursley is sister but they had not met for several years in fact mrs eosstop dursley pretended she did not have a sister because her sister and her goodfornothing husband were as undursleyish as it was possible to be eosstop the dursleys shuddered to think what the neighbors would say if the potters arrived in the street eosstop the dursleys knew that the potters had a small son too but they had never even seen him eosstop this boy was another good reason for keeping the potters away they did not want dudley mixing with a child like that eosstop when mr eosstop and mrs eosstop dursley woke up on the dull gray tuesday our story starts there was nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over the country eosstop mr eosstop dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for work and mrs eosstop dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming dudley into his high chair eosstop none of them noticed a large tawny owl flutter past the window eosstop at half past eight mr eosstop dursley picked up his briefcase pecked mrs eosstop dursley on the cheek and tried to kiss dudley goodbye but missed because dudley was now having a tantrum and throwing his cereal at the walls eosstop startquote little tyke endquote chortled mr eosstop dursley as he left the house eosstop he got into his car and backed out of number four is drive eosstop it was on the corner of the street that he noticed the first sign of something peculiar a cat reading a map eosstop for a second mr eosstop dursley did not realize what he had seen then he jerked his head around to look again eosstop there was a tabby cat standing on the corner of privet drive but there was not a map in sight eosstop what could he have been thinking of eosquestion it must have been a trick of the light eosstop mr eosstop dursley blinked and stared at the cat eosstop it stared back eosstop as mr eosstop dursley drove around the corner and up the road he watched the cat in his mirror eosstop it was now reading the sign that said privet drive no looking at the sign cats could not read maps or signs eosstop mr eosstop dursley gave himself a little shake and put the cat out of his mind eosstop as he drove toward town he thought of nothing except a large order of drills he was hoping to get that day eosstop but on the edge of town drills were driven out of his mind by something else eosstop as he sat in the usual morning traffic jam he could not help noticing that there seemed to be a lot of strangely dressed people about eosstop people in cloaks eosstop mr eosstop dursley could not bear people who dressed in funny clothes the getups you saw on young people eosexclamation he supposed this was some stupid new fashion eosstop he drummed his fingers on the steering wheel and his eyes fell on a huddle of these weirdos standing quite close by eosstop they were whispering excitedly together eosstop mr eosstop dursley was enraged to see that a couple of them were not young at all why that man had to be older than he was and wearing an emeraldgreen cloak eosexclamation the nerve of him eosexclamation but then it struck mr eosstop dursley that this was probably some silly stunt these people were obviously collecting for something eosstop yes that would be it eosstop the traffic moved on and a few minutes later mr eosstop dursley arrived in the grunnings parking lot his mind back on drills eosstop mr eosstop dursley always sat with his back to the window in his office on the ninth floor eosstop if he had not he might have found it harder to concentrate on drills that morning eosstop he did not see the owls swoop ing past in broad daylight though people down in the street did they pointed and gazed open mouthed as owl after owl sped overhead eosstop most of them had never seen an owl even at nighttime eosstop mr eosstop dursley however had a perfectly normal owlfree morning eosstop he yelled at five different people eosstop he made several important telephone calls and shouted a bit more eosstop he was in a very good mood until lunchtime when he thought he would stretch his legs and walk across the road to buy himself a bun from the bakery eosstop he would forgotten all about the people in cloaks until he passed a group of them next to the baker is eosstop he eyed them angrily as he passed eosstop he did not know why but they made him uneasy eosstop this bunch were whispering excitedly too and he could not see a single collecting tin eosstop it was on his way back past them clutching a large doughnut in a bag that he caught a few words of what they were saying eosstop the potters that is right that is what i heard yes their son harry endquote mr eosstop dursley stopped dead eosstop fear flooded him eosstop he looked back at the whisperers as if he wanted to say something to them but thought better of it eosstop he dashed back across the road hurried up to his office snapped at his secretary not to disturb him seized his telephone and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind eosstop he put the receiver back down and stroked his mustache thinking eosstop no he was being stupid eosstop potter was not such an unusual name eosstop he was sure there were lots of people called potter who had a son called harry eosstop come to think of it he was not even sure his nephew was called harry eosstop he would never even seen the boy eosstop it might have been harvey eosstop or harold eosstop there was no point in worrying mrs eosstop dursley she always got so upset at any mention of her sister eosstop he did not blame her if he would had a sister like that eosstop but all the same those people in cloaks eosstop he found it a lot harder to concentrate on drills that afternoon and when he left the building at five oclock he was still so worried that he walked straight into someone just outside the door eosstop sorry endquote he grunted as the tiny old man stumbled and almost fell eosstop it was a few seconds before mr eosstop dursley realized that the man was wearing a violet cloak eosstop he did not seem at all upset at being almost knocked to the ground eosstop on the contrary his face split into a wide smile and he said in a squeaky voice that made passersby stare startquote do not be sorry my dear sir for nothing could upset me today eosexclamation rejoice for youknowwho has gone at last eosexclamation even muggles like yourself should be celebrating this happy happy day eosexclamation endquote and the old man hugged mr eosstop dursley around the middle and walked off eosstop mr eosstop dursley stood rooted to the spot eosstop he had been hugged by a complete stranger eosstop he also thought he had been called a muggle whatever that was eosstop he was rattled eosstop he hurried to his car and set off for home hoping he was imagining things which he had never hoped before because he did not approve of imagination eosstop as he pulled into the driveway of number four the first thing he saw and it did not improve his mood was the tabby cat he would spotted that morning eosstop it was now sitting on his garden wall eosstop he was sure it was the same one it had the same markings around its eyes eosstop shoo eosexclamation endquote said mr eosstop dursley loudly eosstop the cat did not move eosstop it just gave him a stern look eosstop was this normal cat behavior eosquestion mr eosstop dursley wondered eosstop trying to pull himself together he let himself into the house eosstop he was still determined not to mention anything to his wife eosstop mrs eosstop dursley had had a nice normal day eosstop she told him over dinner all about mrs eosstop next door is problems with her daughter and how dudley had learned a new word wo not eosexclamation eosstop mr eosstop dursley tried to act normally eosstop when dudley had been put to bed he went into the living room in time to catch the last report on the evening news startquote and finally birdwatchers everywhere have reported that the nation is owls have been behaving very unusually today eosstop although owls normally hunt at night and are hardly ever seen in daylight there have been hundreds of sightings of these birds flying in every direction since sunrise eosstop experts are unable to explain why the owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern eosstop endquote the newscaster allowed himself a grin eosstop most mysterious eosstop and now over to jim mcguffin with the weather eosstop going to be any more showers of owls tonight jim eosquestion endquote well ted endquote said the weatherman startquote i do not know about that but it is not only the owls that have been acting oddly today eosstop viewers as far apart as kent yorkshire and dundee have been phoning in to tell me that instead of the rain i promised yesterday they have had a downpour of shooting stars eosexclamation perhaps people have been celebrating bonfire night early it is not until next week folks eosexclamation but i can promise a wet night tonight eosstop endquote mr eosstop dursley sat frozen in his armchair eosstop shooting stars all over britain eosquestion owls flying by daylight eosquestion mysterious people in cloaks all over the place eosquestion and a whisper a whisper about the potters eosstop mrs eosstop dursley came into the living room carrying two cups of tea eosstop it was no good eosstop he would have to say something to her eosstop he cleared his throat nervously eosstop startquote er petunia dear you have not heard from your sister lately have you eosquestion endquote as he had expected mrs eosstop dursley looked shocked and angry eosstop after all they normally pretended she did not have a sister eosstop no endquote she said sharply eosstop startquote why eosquestion endquote funny stuff on the news endquote mr eosstop dursley mumbled eosstop startquote owls eosstop shooting stars eosstop and there were a lot of funnylooking people in town today eosstop endquote so eosquestion endquote snapped mrs eosstop dursley eosstop well i just thought eosstop maybe eosstop it was something to do with eosstop you know eosstop her crowd eosstop endquote mrs eosstop dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips eosstop mr eosstop dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he would heard the name startquote potter eosstop endquote he decided he did not dare eosstop instead he said as casually as he could startquote their son he would be about dudley is age now would not he eosquestion endquote i suppose so endquote said mrs eosstop dursley stiffly eosstop what is his name again eosquestion howard is not it eosquestion endquote harry eosstop nasty common name if you ask me eosstop endquote oh yes endquote said mr eosstop dursley his heart sinking horribly eosstop startquote yes i quite agree eosstop endquote he did not say another word on the subject as they went upstairs to bed eosstop while mrs eosstop dursley was in the bathroom mr eosstop dursley crept to the bedroom window and peered down into the front garden eosstop the cat was still there eosstop it was staring down privet drive as though it were waiting for something eosstop was he imagining things eosquestion could all this have anything to do with the potters eosquestion if it did eosstop if it got out that they were related to a pair of well he did not think he could bear it eosstop the dursleys got into bed eosstop mrs eosstop dursley fell asleep quickly but mr eosstop dursley lay awake turning it all over in his mind eosstop his last comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if the potters were involved there was no reason for them to come near him and mrs eosstop dursley eosstop the potters knew very well what he and petunia thought about them and their kind eosstop eosstop he could not see how he and petunia could get mixed up in anything that might be going on he yawned and turned over it could not affect them eosstop eosstop how very wrong he was eosstop mr eosstop dursley might have been drifting into an uneasy sleep but the cat on the wall outside was showing no sign of sleepiness eosstop it was sitting as still as a statue its eyes fixed unblinkingly on the far corner of privet drive eosstop it did not so much as quiver when a car door slammed on the next street nor when two owls swooped overhead eosstop in fact it was nearly midnight before the cat moved at all eosstop a man appeared on the corner the cat had been watching appeared so suddenly and silently you would have thought he would just popped out of the ground eosstop the cat is tail twitched and its eyes narrowed eosstop nothing like this man had ever been seen on privet drive eosstop he was tall thin and very old judging by the silver of his hair and beard which were both long enough to tuck into his belt eosstop he was wearing long robes a purple cloak that swept the ground and highheeled buckled boots eosstop his blue eyes were light bright and sparkling behind halfmoon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked as though it had been broken at least twice eosstop this man is name was albus dumbledore eosstop albus dumbledore did not seem to realize that he had just arrived in a street where everything from his name to his boots was unwelcome eosstop he was busy rummaging in his cloak looking for something eosstop but he did seem to realize he was being watched because he looked up suddenly at the cat which was still staring at him from the other end of the street eosstop for some reason the sight of the cat seemed to amuse him eosstop he chuckled and muttered startquote i should have known eosstop endquote he found what he was looking for in his inside pocket eosstop it seemed to be a silver cigarette lighter eosstop he flicked it open held it up in the air and clicked it eosstop the nearest street lamp went out with a little pop eosstop he clicked it again the next lamp flickered into darkness eosstop twelve times he clicked the putouter until the only lights left on the whole street were two tiny pinpricks in the distance which were the eyes of the cat watching him eosstop if anyone looked out of their window now even beadyeyed mrs eosstop dursley they would not be able to see anything that was happening down on the pavement eosstop dumbledore slipped the putouter back inside his cloak and set off down the street toward number four where he sat down on the wall next to the cat eosstop he did not look at it but after a moment he spoke to it eosstop fancy seeing you here professor mcgonagall eosstop endquote he turned to smile at the tabby but it had gone eosstop instead he was smiling at a rather severelooking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly the shape of the markings the cat had had around its eyes eosstop she too was wearing a cloak an emerald one eosstop her black hair was drawn into a tight bun eosstop she looked distinctly ruffled eosstop how did you know it was me eosquestion endquote she asked eosstop my dear professor i have never seen a cat sit so stiffly eosstop endquote you would be stiff if you would been sitting on a brick wall all day endquote said professor mcgonagall eosstop all day eosquestion when you could have been celebrating eosquestion i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here eosstop endquote professor mcgonagall sniffed angrily eosstop oh yes everyone is celebrating all right endquote she said impatiently eosstop you would think they would be a bit more careful but no even the muggles have noticed something is going on eosstop it was on their news eosstop endquote she jerked her head back at the dursleys dark livingroom window eosstop startquote i heard it eosstop flocks of owls eosstop shooting stars eosstop eosstop well they are not completely stupid eosstop they were bound to notice something eosstop shooting stars down in kent i will bet that was dedalus diggle eosstop he never had much sense eosstop endquote you can not blame them endquote said dumbledore gently eosstop startquote we have had precious little to celebrate for eleven years eosstop endquote i know that endquote said professor mcgonagall irritably eosstop startquote but that is no reason to lose our heads eosstop people are being downright careless out on the streets in broad daylight not even dressed in muggle clothes swapping rumors eosstop endquote she threw a sharp sideways glance at dumbledore here as though hoping he was going to tell her something but he did not so she went on eosstop startquote a fine thing it would be if on the very day youknowwho seems to have disappeared at last the muggles found out about us all eosstop i suppose he really has gone dumbledore eosquestion endquote it certainly seems so endquote said dumbledore eosstop startquote we have much to be thankful for eosstop would you care for a lemon drop eosquestion endquote a what eosquestion endquote a lemon drop eosstop they are a kind of muggle sweet i am rather fond of endquote no thank you endquote said professor mcgonagall coldly as though she did not think this was the moment for lemon drops eosstop startquote as i say even if youknowwho has gone endquote my dear professor surely a sensible person like yourself can call him by his name eosquestion all this you knowwho nonsense for eleven years i have been trying to persuade people to call him by his proper name voldemort eosstop endquote professor mcgonagall flinched but dumbledore who was unsticking two lemon drops seemed not to notice eosstop startquote it all gets so confusing if we keep saying youknowwho eosstop i have never seen any reason to be frightened of saying voldemort is name eosstop i know you haven not said professor mcgonagall sounding half exasperated half admiring eosstop startquote but you are different eosstop everyone knows you are the only one youknow oh all right voldemort was frightened of eosstop endquote you flatter me endquote said dumbledore calmly eosstop startquote voldemort had powers i will never have eosstop endquote only because you are too well noble to use them eosstop endquote it is lucky it is dark eosstop i have not blushed so much since madam pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs eosstop endquote professor mcgonagall shot a sharp look at dumbledore and said startquote the owls are nothing next to the rumors that are flying around eosstop you know what everyone is saying eosquestion about why he is disappeared eosquestion about what finally stopped him eosquestion endquote it seemed that professor mcgonagall had reached the point she was most anxious to discuss the real reason she had been waiting on a cold hard wall all day for neither as a cat nor as a woman had she fixed dumbledore with such a piercing stare as she did now eosstop it was plain that whatever startquote everyone endquote was saying she was not going to believe it until dumbledore told her it was true eosstop dumbledore however was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer eosstop what they are saying endquote she pressed on startquote is that last night voldemort turned up in godric is hollow eosstop he went to find the potters eosstop the rumor is that lily and james potter are are that they are dead eosstop “ dumbledore bowed his head eosstop professor mcgonagall gasped eosstop lily and james eosstop i can not believe it eosstop i did not want to believe it eosstop oh albus eosstop endquote dumbledore reached out and patted her on the shoulder eosstop startquote i know eosstop i know eosstop endquote he said heavily eosstop professor mcgonagall is voice trembled as she went on eosstop startquote that is not all eosstop they are saying he tried to kill the potter is son harry eosstop but he could not eosstop he could not kill that little boy eosstop no one knows why or how but they are saying that when he could not kill harry potter voldemort is power somehow broke and that is why he is gone eosstop dumbledore nodded glumly eosstop it is it is true eosquestion endquote faltered professor mcgonagall eosstop startquote after all he is done eosstop all the people he is killed eosstop he could not kill a little boy eosquestion it is just astounding eosstop of all the things to stop him eosstop but how in the name of heaven did harry survive eosquestion endquote we can only guess endquote said dumbledore eosstop startquote we may never know eosstop endquote professor mcgonagall pulled out a lace handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes beneath her spectacles eosstop dumbledore gave a great sniff as he took a golden watch from his pocket and examined it eosstop it was a very odd watch eosstop it had twelve hands but no numbers instead little planets were moving around the edge eosstop it must have made sense to dumbledore though because he put it back in his pocket and said startquote hagrid is late eosstop i suppose it was he who told you i would be here by the way eosquestion endquote yes endquote said professor mcgonagall eosstop startquote and i do not suppose you are going to tell me why you are here of all places eosquestion endquote i have come to bring harry to his aunt and uncle eosstop they are the only family he has left now eosstop endquote you do not mean you can not mean the people who live here eosquestion endquote cried professor mcgonagall jumping to her feet and pointing at number four eosstop dumbledore you can not eosstop i have been watching them all day eosstop you could not find two people who are less like us eosstop and they have got this son i saw him kicking his mother all the way up the street screaming for sweets eosstop harry potter come and live here eosexclamation endquote it is the best place for him endquote said dumbledore firmly eosstop startquote his aunt and uncle will be able to explain everything to him when he is older eosstop i have written them a letter eosstop endquote a letter eosquestion endquote repeated professor mcgonagall faintly sitting back down on the wall eosstop startquote really dumbledore you think you can explain all this in a letter eosquestion these people will never understand him eosexclamation he will be famous a legend i would not be surprised if today was known as harry potter day in the future there will be books written about harry every child in our world will know his name eosexclamation endquote exactly endquote said dumbledore looking very seriously over the top of his halfmoon glasses eosstop startquote it would be enough to turn any boy is head eosstop famous before he can walk and talk eosexclamation famous for something he will not even remember eosexclamation cara you see how much better off he will be growing up away from all that until he is ready to take it eosquestion endquote professor mcgonagall opened her mouth changed her mind swallowed and then said startquote yes yes you are right of course eosstop but how is the boy getting here dumbledore eosquestion endquote she eyed his cloak suddenly as though she thought he might be hiding harry underneath it eosstop hagrid is bringing him eosstop endquote you think it wise to trust hagrid with something as important as this eosquestion endquote i would trust hagrid with my life endquote said dumbledore eosstop i am not saying his heart is not in the right place endquote said professor mcgonagall grudgingly startquote but you can not pretend he is not careless eosstop he does tend to what was that eosquestion endquote a low rumbling sound had broken the silence around them eosstop it grew steadily louder as they looked up and down the street for some sign of a headlight it swelled to a roar as they both looked up at the sky and a huge motorcycle fell out of the air and landed on the road in front of them eosstop if the motorcycle was huge it was nothing to the man sitting astride it eosstop he was almost twice as tall as a normal man and at least five times as wide eosstop he looked simply too big to be allowed and so wild long tangles of bushy black hair and beard hid most of his face he had hands the size of trash can lids and his feet in their leather boots were like baby dolphins eosstop in his vast muscular arms he was holding a bundle of blankets eosstop hagrid endquote said dumbledore sounding relieved eosstop startquote at last eosstop and where did you get that motorcycle eosquestion endquote borrowed it professor dumbledore sit endquote said the giant climbing carefully off the motorcycle as he spoke eosstop startquote young sirius black lent it to me eosstop i have got him sir eosstop endquote no problems were there eosquestion endquote no sir house was almost destroyed but i got him out all right before the muggles started swarmin around eosstop he fell asleep as we was flyin over bristol eosstop endquote dumbledore and professor mcgonagall bent forward over the bundle of blankets eosstop inside just visible was a baby boy fast asleep eosstop under a tuft of jetblack hair over his forehead they could see a curiously shaped cut like a bolt of lightning eosstop is that where eosquestion endquote whispered professor mcgonagall eosstop yes endquote said dumbledore eosstop startquote he will have that scar forever eosstop endquote could not you do something about it dumbledore eosquestion endquote even if i could i would not eosstop scars can come in handy eosstop i have one myself above my left knee that is a perfect map of the london underground eosstop well give him here hagrid we would better get this over with eosstop endquote dumbledore took harry in his arms and turned toward the dursleys house eosstop could i could i say goodbye to him sir eosquestion endquote asked hagrid eosstop he bent his great shaggy head over harry and gave him what must have been a very scratchy whiskery kiss eosstop then suddenly hagrid let out a howl like a wounded dog eosstop shhh eosexclamation endquote hissed professor mcgonagall startquote you will wake the muggles eosexclamation endquote sssorry endquote sobbed hagrid taking out a large spotted handkerchief and burying his face in it eosstop startquote but i cccan not stand it lily an james dead an poor little harry off ter live with muggles endquote yes yes it is all very sad but get a grip on yourself hagrid or we will be found endquote professor mcgonagall whispered patting hagrid gingerly on the arm as dumbledore stepped over the low garden wall and walked to the front door eosstop he laid harry gently on the doorstep took a letter out of his cloak tucked it inside harry is blankets and then came back to the other two eosstop for a full minute the three of them stood and looked at the little bundle hagrid is shoulders shook professor mcgonagall blinked furiously and the twinkling light that usually shone from dumbledore is eyes seemed to have gone out eosstop well endquote said dumbledore finally startquote that is that eosstop we have no business staying here eosstop we may as well go and join the celebrations eosstop endquote yeah endquote said hagrid in a very muffled voice startquote i will be takin sirius his bike back eosstop gnight professor mcgonagall professor dumbledore sir eosstop endquote wiping his streaming eyes on his jacket sleeve hagrid swung himself onto the motorcycle and kicked the engine into life with a roar it rose into the air and off into the night eosstop i shall see you soon i expect professor mcgonagall endquote said dumbledore nodding to her eosstop professor mcgonagall blew her nose in reply eosstop dumbledore turned and walked back down the street eosstop on the corner he stopped and took out the silver putouter eosstop he clicked it once and twelve balls of light sped back to their street lamps so that privet drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out a tabby cat slinking around the corner at the other end of the street eosstop he could just see the bundle of blankets on the step of number four eosstop good luck harry endquote he murmured eosstop he turned on his heel and with a swish of his cloak he was gone eosstop a breeze ruffled the neat hedges of privet drive which lay silent and tidy under the inky sky the very last place you would expect astonishing things to happen eosstop harry potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up eosstop one small hand closed on the letter beside him and he slept on not knowing he was special not knowing he was famous not knowing he would be woken in a few hours time by mrs eosstop dursley is scream as she opened the front door to put out the milk bottles nor that he would spend the next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin dudley eosstop he could not know that at this very moment people meeting in secret all over the country were holding up their glasses and saying in hushed voices startquote to harry potter the boy who lived eosexclamation endquote chapter two the vanishing glass nearly ten years had passed since the dursleys had woken up to find their nephew on the front step but privet drive had hardly changed at all eosstop the sun rose on the same tidy front gardens and lit up the brass number four on the dursleys front door it crept into their living room which was almost exactly the same as it had been on the night when mr eosstop dursley had seen that fateful news report about the owls eosstop only the photographs on the mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed eosstop ten years ago there had been lots of pictures of what looked like a large pink beach ball wearing differentcolored bonnets but dudley dursley was no longer a baby and now the photographs showed a large blond boy riding his first bicycle on a carousel at the fair playing a computer game with his father being hugged and kissed by his mother eosstop the room held no sign at all that another boy lived in the house too eosstop yet harry potter was still there asleep at the moment but not for long eosstop his aunt petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made the first noise of the day eosstop up eosexclamation get up eosexclamation now eosexclamation endquote harry woke with a start eosstop his aunt rapped on the door again eosstop up eosexclamation endquote she screeched eosstop harry heard her walking toward the kitchen and then the sound of the frying pan being put on the stove eosstop he rolled onto his back and tried to remember the dream he had been having eosstop it had been a good one eosstop there had been a flying motorcycle in it eosstop he had a funny feeling he would had the same dream before eosstop his aunt was back outside the door eosstop are you up yet eosquestion endquote she demanded eosstop nearly endquote said harry eosstop well get a move on i want you to look after the bacon eosstop and do not you dare let it burn i want everything perfect on duddy is birthday eosstop endquote harry groaned eosstop what did you say eosquestion endquote his aunt snapped through the door eosstop nothing nothing eosstop endquote dudley is birthday how could he have forgotten eosquestion harry got slowly out of bed and started looking for socks eosstop he found a pair under his bed and after pulling a spider off one of them put them on eosstop harry was used to spiders because the cupboard under the stairs was full of them and that was where he slept eosstop when he was dressed he went down the hall into the kitchen eosstop the table was almost hidden beneath all dudley is birthday presents eosstop it looked as though dudley had gotten the new computer he wanted not to mention the second television and the racing bike eosstop exactly why dudley wanted a racing bike was a mystery to harry as dudley was very fat and hated exercise unless of course it involved punching somebody eosstop dudley is favorite punching bag was harry but he could not often catch him eosstop harry did not look it but he was very fast eosstop perhaps it had something to do with living in a dark cupboard but harry had always been small and skinny for his age eosstop he looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had to wear were old clothes of dudley is and dudley was about four times bigger than he was eosstop harry had a thin face knobbly knees black hair and bright green eyes eosstop he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose eosstop the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning eosstop he had had it as long as he could remember and the first question he could ever remember asking his aunt petunia was how he had gotten it eosstop in the car crash when your parents died endquote she had said eosstop startquote and do not ask questions eosstop endquote do not ask questions that was the first rule for a quiet life with the dursleys eosstop uncle vernon entered the kitchen as harry was turning over the bacon eosstop comb your hair eosexclamation endquote he barked by way of a morning greeting eosstop about once a week uncle vernon looked over the top of his newspaper and shouted that harry needed a haircut eosstop harry must have had more haircuts than the rest of the boys in his class put together but it made no difference his hair simply grew that way all over the place eosstop harry was frying eggs by the time dudley arrived in the kitchen with his mother eosstop dudley looked a lot like uncle vernon eosstop he had a large pink face not much neck small watery blue eyes and thick blond hair that lay smoothly on his thick fat head eosstop aunt petunia often said that dudley looked like a baby angel harry often said that dudley looked like a pig in a wig eosstop harry put the plates of egg and bacon on the table which was difficult as there was not much room eosstop dudley meanwhile was counting his presents eosstop his face fell eosstop thirtysix endquote he said looking up at his mother and father eosstop startquote that is two less than last year eosstop endquote darling you have not counted auntie marge is present see it is here under this big one from mommy and daddy eosstop endquote all right thirtyseven then endquote said dudley going red in the face eosstop harry who could see a huge dudley tantrum coming on began wolfing down his bacon as fast as possible in case dudley turned the table over eosstop aunt petunia obviously scented danger too because she said quickly startquote and we will buy you another two presents while we are out today eosstop how is that popkin eosquestion two more presents eosstop is that all right dudley thought for a moment eosstop it looked like hard work eosstop finally he said slowly startquote so i will have thirty eosstop thirty eosstop endquote thirtynine sweetums endquote said aunt petunia eosstop oh eosstop endquote dudley sat down heavily and grabbed the nearest parcel eosstop startquote all right then eosstop endquote uncle vernon chuckled eosstop startquote little tyke wants his money is worth just like his father eosstop atta boy dudley eosexclamation endquote he ruffled dudley is hair eosstop at that moment the telephone rang and aunt petunia went to answer it while harry and uncle vernon watched dudley unwrap the racing bike a video camera a remote control airplane sixteen new computer games and a vcr eosstop he was ripping the paper off a gold wristwatch when aunt petunia came back from the telephone looking both angry and worried eosstop bad news vernon endquote she said eosstop startquote mrs eosstop figg is broken her leg eosstop she can not take him eosstop endquote she jerked her head in harry is direction eosstop dudley is mouth fell open in horror but harry is heart gave a leap eosstop every year on dudley is birthday his parents took him and a friend out for the day to

few moldy blankets in the second room and made up a bed for dudley on the motheaten sofa eosstop she and uncle vernon went off to the lumpy bed next door and harry was left to find the softest bit of floor he could and to curl up under the thinnest most ragged blanket eosstop the storm raged more and more ferociously as the night went on eosstop harry could not sleep eosstop he shivered and turned over trying to get comfortable his stomach rumbling with hunger eosstop dudley is snores were drowned by the low rolls of thunder that started near midnight eosstop the lighted dial of dudley is watch which was dangling over the edge of the sofa on his fat wrist told harry he would be eleven in ten minutes time eosstop he lay and watched his birthday tick nearer wondering if the dursleys would remember at all wondering where the letter writer was now eosstop five minutes to go eosstop harry heard something creak outside eosstop he hoped the roof was not going to fall in although he might be warmer if it did eosstop four minutes to go eosstop maybe the house in privet drive would be so full of letters when they got back that he would be able to steal one somehow eosstop three minutes to go eosstop was that the sea slapping hard on the rock like that eosquestion and two minutes to go what was that funny crunching noise eosquestion was the rock crumbling into the sea eosquestion one

armed eosexclamation endquote there was a pause eosstop then – smash eosexclamation the door was hit with such force that it swung clean off its hinges and with a deafening crash landed flat on the floor eosstop a giant of a man was standing in the doorway eosstop his face was almost completely hidden by a long shaggy mane of hair and a wild tangled beard but you could make out his eyes glinting like black beetles under all the hair eosstop the giant squeezed his way into the hut stooping so that his head just brushed the ceiling eosstop he bent down picked up the door and fitted it easily back into its frame eosstop the noise of the storm outside dropped a little eosstop he turned to look at them all eosstop could not make us a cup o tea could yeh eosquestion it is not been an easy journey eosstop endquote he strode over to the sofa where dudley sat frozen with fear eosstop budge up yeh great lump endquote said the stranger eosstop dudley squeaked and ran to hide behind his mother who was crouching terrified behind uncle vernon eosstop an here is harry eosexclamation endquote said the giant eosstop harry looked up into the fierce wild shadowy face and saw that the beetle eyes were crinkled in a smile eosstop las time i saw you you was only a baby endquote said the giant eosstop startquote yeh look a lot like yet dad but yeh have got yet mom is eyes eosstop endquote uncle vernon made a funny rasping noise eosstop i demand that you leave at once sit eosexclamation endquote he said eosstop startquote you are breaking and entering eosexclamation endquote ah shut up

a very happy birthday to yeh eosstop got summat fer yeh here i mighta sat on it at some point but it will taste all right eosstop endquote from an inside pocket of his black overcoat he pulled a slightly squashed box eosstop harry opened it with trembling fingers eosstop inside was a large sticky chocolate cake with happy birthday harry written on it in green icing eosstop harry looked up at the giant eosstop he meant to say thank you but the words got lost on the way to his mouth and what he said instead was startquote who are you eosquestion endquote the giant chuckled eosstop true i

eosquestion endquote he said rubbing his hands together eosstop i would not say no ter summat stronger if yeh have got it mind eosstop endquote his eyes fell on the empty grate with the shriveled chip bags in it and he snorted eosstop he bent down over the fireplace they could not see what he was doing but when he drew back a second later there was a roaring fire there eosstop it filled the whole damp hut with flickering light and harry felt the warmth wash over him as though he would sunk into a hot bath eosstop the giant sat back down on the sofa which sagged under his weight and began taking all sorts of things out of the pockets of his coat a copper kettle a squashy package of sausages a poker a teapot several chipped mugs and a bottle of some amber liquid that he took a swig from before starting to make tea eosstop soon the hut was full of the sound and smell of sizzling sausage eosstop nobody said a thing while the giant was working but as he slid the first six fat juicy slightly burnt sausages from the poker dudley fidgeted a little eosstop uncle vernon said sharply startquote do not touch anything he gives you dudley eosstop endquote the giant chuckled darkly eosstop yet great puddin of a son don need fattenin anymore dursley don worry eosstop endquote he passed the sausages to harry who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful but he still could not take his eyes off the giant eosstop finally as nobody seemed about to explain anything he said startquote i am sorry but i still do not really know who you are eosstop endquote the giant took a gulp of tea and wiped his mouth with the back of his hand eosstop call me hagrid endquote he said startquote everyone does eosstop an like i told yeh i am keeper of keys at hogwarts yeh will

eosstop your platform should be somewhere in the middle but they do not seem to have built it yet do they eosquestion endquote he was quite right of course eosstop there was a big plastic number nine

threequarters eosstop the guard had never heard of hogwarts and when harry could not even tell him what part of the country it was in he started to get annoyed as though harry was being stupid on purpose eosstop getting desperate harry asked for the train that left at eleven oclock but the guard said there was not one eosstop in the end the guard strode away muttering about time wasters eosstop harry was now trying hard not to panic eosstop according to the large clock over the arrivals board he had ten minutes left to get on the train to hogwarts and he had no idea how to do it he was stranded in the middle of a station with a trunk he could hardly lift a pocket full of wizard money and a large owl eosstop hagrid must have forgotten to tell him something you had to do like tapping the third brick on the left to get into diagon alley eosstop he wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping the ticket inspector is stand between platforms nine and ten eosstop at that moment a group of people passed just behind him and he caught a few words of what they were saying eosstop packed with muggles of course endquote harry swung round eosstop the speaker was a plump

the engine drifted over the heads of the chattering crowd while cats of every color wound here and there between their legs eosstop owls hooted to one another in a disgruntled sort of way over the babble and the scraping of heavy trunks eosstop the first few carriages were already packed with students some hanging out of the window to talk to their families some fighting over seats eosstop harry pushed his cart off down the platform in search of an empty seat eosstop he passed a roundfaced boy who was saying startquote gran i have lost my toad again eosstop endquote oh neville endquote

around him shrieked and yelled as something inside poked out a long hairy leg eosstop harry pressed on through the crowd until he found an empty compartment near the end of the train eosstop he put hedwig inside first and then started to shove and heave his trunk toward the train door eosstop he tried to lift it up the steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully on his foot eosstop want a hand eosquestion endquote it was one of the redhaired twins he would followed through the barrier eosstop yes please endquote harry panted eosstop oy fred eosexclamation c amere

at once eosstop the minutes crept by eosstop he is late maybe he is chickened out endquote ron whispered eosstop then a noise in the next room made them jump eosstop harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it was not malfoy eosstop sniff around my sweet they might be lurking in a corner eosstop endquote it was filch speaking to mrs eosstop norris eosstop horrorstruck harry waved madly at the other three to follow him as quickly as possible they scurried silently toward the door away from filch is voice eosstop neville is robes had barely whipped round

that eosstop let is go eosstop endquote it was not going to be that simple eosstop they had not gone more than a dozen paces when a doorknob rattled and something came shooting out of a classroom in

endquote for neville had been tugging on the sleeve of harry is bathrobe for the last minute eosstop startquote what eosquestion endquote harry turned around and saw quite clearly what eosstop for a moment he was sure he would walked into a nightmare this was too much on top of everything that had happened so far eosstop they were not in a room as he had supposed eosstop they were in a corridor eosstop the forbidden corridor on the third floor eosstop and now they knew why it was forbidden eosstop they were looking straight into the eyes of a monstrous dog a dog that filled the whole space between ceiling and floor eosstop it had three heads eosstop three pairs of rolling mad eyes three noses twitching and quivering in their direction three drooling mouths saliva hanging in slippery ropes from yellowish fangs eosstop it was standing quite still all six eyes staring at them and harry knew that the only reason they were not already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise but it was quickly getting over that there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant eosstop harry groped for the doorknob between filch and death he would take filch eosstop they fell backward harry slammed the door shut and they ran they almost flew back down the corridor eosstop filch must have hurried off to look for them somewhere else because they did not see him anywhere but they hardly cared all they wanted to do was put as much space as possible between them and that monster eosstop they did not stop running until they reached the portrait of the fat lady on the seventh floor eosstop where on earth have you all been eosquestion endquote she asked looking at their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed sweaty faces eosstop never mind that pig snout pig snout endquote panted harry and the portrait swung forward eosstop they scrambled into the common room and collapsed trembling into armchairs eosstop it was a while before any of them said anything eosstop neville indeed looked as if he would never speak again eosstop what do they think they are doing keeping a thing like that locked up in a school eosquestion endquote said ron finally eosstop startquote if any dog needs exercise that one does eosstop endquote hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again eosstop startquote you do not use your eyes any of you do you eosquestion endquote she snapped eosstop startquote did not you see what it was standing on eosstop the floor eosquestion endquote harry suggested eosstop startquote i was not looking at its feet i was too busy with its heads eosstop endquote no not the floor eosstop it was standing on a trapdoor eosstop it is obviously guarding something eosstop endquote she stood up glaring at them eosstop i hope you are pleased with yourselves eosstop we could all have been killed or worse expelled eosstop now if you do not mind i am going to bed eosstop endquote ron stared after her his mouth open eosstop no we do not mind endquote he said eosstop startquote you would think we dragged her along would not you eosstop but hermione had given harry something else to think about as he climbed back into bed eosstop the dog was guarding something eosstop eosstop what had hagrid said eosquestion gringotts was the safest place in the world for something you wanted to hide except perhaps hogwarts eosstop it looked as though harry had found out where the grubby littie package from vault seven hundred and thirteen was eosstop chapter ten halloween malfoy could not believe his eyes when he saw that harry and ron were still at hogwarts the next day looking tired but perfectly cheerful eosstop indeed by the next morning harry and ron thought that meeting the threeheaded dog had been an excellent adventure and they were quite keen to have another one eosstop in the meantime harry filled ron in about the package that seemed to have been moved from gringotts to hogwarts and they spent a lot of time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection eosstop startquote it is either really valuable or really dangerous endquote said ron eosstop or both endquote said harry eosstop but as all they knew for sure about the mysterious object was that it was about two inches long they did not have much chance of guessing what it was without further clues eosstop neither neville nor hermione showed the slightest interest in what lay underneath the dog and the trapdoor eosstop all neville cared about was never going near the dog again eosstop hermione was now refusing to speak to harry and ron but she was such a bossy knowitall that they saw this as an added bonus eosstop all they really wanted now was a way of getting back at malfoy and to their great delight just such a thing arrived in the mail about a week later eosstop as the owls flooded into the great hall as usual everyone is attention was caught at once by a long thin package carried by six large screech owls eosstop harry was just as interested as everyone else to see what was in this large parcel and was amazed when the owls soared down and dropped it right in front of him knocking his bacon to the floor eosstop they had hardly fluttered out of the way when another owl dropped a letter on top of the parcel eosstop harry ripped open the letter first which was lucky because it said do not open the parcel at the table eosstop it contains your new nimbus two thousand but i do not want everybody knowing you have got a broomstick or they will all want one eosstop oliver wood will meet you tonight on the quidditch field at seven oclock for your first training session eosstop professor mcgonagall harry had difficulty hiding his glee as he handed the note to ron to read eosstop a nimbus two thousand eosexclamation endquote ron moaned enviously eosstop startquote i have never even touched one eosstop endquote they left the hall quickly wanting to unwrap the broomstick in private before their first class but halfway across the entrance hall they found the way upstairs barred by crabbe and goyle eosstop malfoy seized the package from harry and felt it eosstop that is a broomstick endquote he said throwing it back to harry with a mixture of jealousy and spite on his face eosstop startquote you will be in for it this time potter first years are not allowed them eosstop endquote ron could not resist it eosstop it is not any old broomstick endquote he said startquote it is a nimbus two thousand eosstop what did you say you have got at home malfoy a comet two sixty eosquestion endquote ron grinned at harry eosstop startquote comets look flashy but they are not in the same league as the nimbus eosstop endquote what would you know about it weasley you could not afford half the handle endquote malfoy snapped back eosstop startquote i suppose you and your brothers have to save up twig by twig eosstop endquote before ron could answer professor flitwick appeared at malfoy is elbow eosstop not arguing i hope boys eosquestion endquote he squeaked eosstop potter is been sent a broomstick professor endquote said malfoy quickly eosstop yes yes that is right endquote said professor flitwick beaming at harry eosstop professor mcgonagall told me all about the special circumstances potter eosstop and what model is it eosquestion endquote a nimbus two thousand sit endquote said harry fighting not to laugh at the look of horror on malfoy is face eosstop startquote and it is really thanks to malfoy here that i have got it endquote he added eosstop harry and ron headed upstairs smothering their laughter at malfoy is obvious rage and confusion eosstop startquote well it is true endquote harry chortled as they reached the top of the marble staircase startquote if he had not stolen neville is remembrall i woul not be on the team eosstop eosstop endquote so i suppose you think that is a reward for breaking rules eosquestion endquote came an angry voice from just behind them eosstop hermione was stomping up the stairs looking disapprovingly at the package in harry is hand eosstop i thought you were not speaking to us eosquestion endquote said harry eosstop yes do not stop now endquote said ron startquote it is doing us so much good eosstop endquote hermione marched away with her nose in the air eosstop harry had a lot of trouble keeping his mind on his lessons that day eosstop it kept wandering up to the dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed or straying off to the quidditch field where he would be learning to play that night eosstop he bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating and then rushed upstairs with ron to unwrap the nimbus two thousand at last eosstop wow endquote ron sighed as the broomstick rolled onto harry is bedspread eosstop even harry who knew nothing about the different brooms thought it looked wonderful eosstop sleek and shiny with a mahogany handle it had a long tail of neat straight twigs and nimbus two thousand written in gold near the top eosstop as seven oclock drew nearer harry left the castle and set off in the dusk toward the quidditch field eosstop held never been inside the stadium before eosstop hundreds of seats were raised in stands around the field so that the spectators were high enough to see what was going on eosstop at either end of the field were three golden poles with hoops on the end eosstop they reminded harry of the little plastic sticks muggle children blew bubbles through except that they were fifty feet high eosstop too eager to fly again to wait for wood harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off from the ground eosstop what a feeling he swooped in and out of the goal posts and then sped up and down the field eosstop the nimbus two thousand turned wherever he wanted at his lightest touch eosstop hey potter come down eosexclamation oliver wood had arrived eosstop fie was carrying a large wooden crate under his arm eosstop harry landed next to him eosstop very nice endquote said wood his eyes glinting eosstop startquote i see what mcgonagall meant eosstop you really are a natural eosstop i am just going to teach you the rules this evening then you will be joining team practice three times a week eosstop endquote he opened the crate eosstop inside were four differentsized balls eosstop right endquote said wood eosstop startquote now quidditch is easy enough to understand even if it is not too easy to play eosstop there are seven players on each side eosstop three of them are called chasers eosstop endquote three chasers endquote harry repeated as wood took out a bright red ball about the size of a soccer ball eosstop this ball is called the quaffle endquote said wood eosstop startquote the chasers throw the quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal eosstop ten points every time the quaffle goes through one of the hoops eosstop follow me eosquestion endquote the chasers throw the quaffle and put it through the hoops to score endquote harry recited eosstop startquote so that is sort of like basketball on broomsticks with six hoops is not it eosquestion endquote what is basketball eosquestion endquote said wood curiously eosstop startquote never mind endquote said harry quickly eosstop now there is another player on each side who is called the keeper i am keeper for gryffindor eosstop i have to fly around our hoops and stop the other team from scoring eosstop endquote three chasers one keeper endquote said harry who was determined to remember it all eosstop startquote and they play with the quaffle eosstop okay got that eosstop so what are they for eosquestion endquote he pointed at the three balls left inside the box eosstop i will show you now endquote said wood eosstop startquote take this eosstop endquote he handed harry a small club a bit like a short baseball bat eosstop i am going to show you what the bludgers do endquote wood said eosstop startquote these two are the bludgers eosstop endquote he showed harry two identical balls jet black and slightly smaller than the red quaffle eosstop harry noticed that they seemed to be straining to escape the straps holding them inside the box eosstop stand back endquote wood warned harry eosstop he bent down and freed one of the bludgers eosstop at once the black ball rose high in the air and then pelted straight at harry is face eosstop harry swung at it with the bat to stop it from breaking his nose and sent it zigzagging away into the air it zoomed around their heads and then shot at wood who dived on top of it and managed to pin it to the ground eosstop see eosquestion endquote wood panted forcing the struggling bludger back into the crate and strapping it down safely eosstop startquote the bludgers rocket around trying to knock players off their brooms eosstop that is why you have two beaters on each team the weasley twins are ours it is their job to protect their side from the bludgers and try and knock them toward the other team eosstop so think you have got all that eosquestion endquote three chasers try and score with the quaffle the keeper guards the goal posts the beaters keep the bludgers away from their team endquote harry reeled off eosstop very good endquote said wood eosstop er have the bludgers ever killed anyone eosquestion endquote harry asked hoping he sounded offhand eosstop never at hogwarts eosstop we have had a couple of broken jaws but nothing worse than that eosstop now the last member of the team is the seeker eosstop that is you eosstop and you do not have to worry about the quaffle or the bludgers unless they crack my head open eosstop endquote do not worry the weasleys are more than a match for the bludgers i mean they are like a pair of human bludgers themselves eosstop endquote wood reached into the crate and took out the fourth and last ball eosstop compared with the quaffle and the bludgers it was tiny about the size of a large walnut eosstop it was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings eosstop this endquote said wood startquote is the golden snitch and it is the most important ball of the lot eosstop it is very hard to catch because it is so fast and difficult to see eosstop it is the seeker is job to catch it eosstop you have got to weave in and out of the chasers beaters bludgers and quaffle to get it before the other team is seeker because whichever seeker catches the snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points so they nearly always win eosstop that is why seekers get fouled so much eosstop a game of quidditch only ends when the snitch is caught so it can go on for ages i think the record is three months they had to keep bringing on substitutes so the players could get some sleep eosstop startquote well that is it any questions eosquestion endquote harry shook his head eosstop he understood what he had to do all right it was doing it that was going to be the problem eosstop we will not practice with the snitch yet endquote said wood carefully shutting it back inside the crate startquote it is too dark we might lose it eosstop let is try you out with a few of these eosstop endquote he pulled a bag of ordinary golf balls out of his pocket and a few minutes later he and harry were up in the air wood throwing the golf balls as hard as he could in every direction for harry to catch eosstop harry did not miss a single one and wood was delighted eosstop after half an hour night had really fallen and they could not carry on eosstop that quidditch cup will have our name on it this year endquote said wood happily as they trudged back up to the castle eosstop startquote i would not be surprised if you turn out better than charlie weasley and he could have played for england if he had not gone off chasing dragons eosstop endquote perhaps it was because he was now so busy what with quidditch practice three evenings a week on top of all his homework but harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he would already been at hogwarts two months eosstop the castle felt more like home than privet drive ever had eosstop his lessons too were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered the basics eosstop on halloween morning they woke to the delicious smell of baking pumpkin wafting through the corridors eosstop even better professor flitwick announced in charms that he thought they were ready to start making objects fly something they had all been dying to try since they would seen him make neville is toad zoom around the classroom eosstop professor flitwick put the class into pairs to practice eosstop harry is partner was seamus finnigan which was a relief because neville had been trying to catch his eye eosstop ron however was to be working with hermione granger eosstop it was hard to tell whether ron or hermione was angrier about this eosstop she had not spoken to either of them since the day harry is broomstick had arrived eosstop now do not forget that nice wrist movement we have been practicing eosexclamation endquote squeaked professor flitwick perched on top of his pile of books as usual eosstop startquote swish and flick remember swish and flick eosstop and saying the magic words properly is very important too never forget wizard baruffio who said is instead of f and found himself on the floor with a buffalo on his chest eosstop endquote it was very difficult eosstop harry and seamus swished and flicked but the feather they were supposed to be sending skyward just lay on the desktop eosstop seamus got so impatient that he prodded it with his wand and set fire to it harry had to put it out with his hat eosstop ron at the next table was not having much more luck eosstop wingardium leviosa eosexclamation endquote he shouted waving his long arms like a windmill eosstop you are saying it wrong endquote harry heard hermione snap eosstop startquote it is winggardium leviosa make the gar nice and long eosstop endquote you do it then if you are so clever endquote ron snarled eosstop hermione rolled up the sleeves of her gown flicked her wand and said startquote wingardium leviosa eosexclamation endquote their feather rose off the desk and hovered about four feet above their heads eosstop oh well done eosexclamation endquote cried professor flitwick clapping eosstop startquote everyone see here miss granger is done it eosexclamation endquote ron was in a very bad mood by the end of the class eosstop startquote it is no wonder no one can stand her endquote he said to harry as they pushed their way into the crowded corridor startquote she is a nightmare honestly eosstop “ someone knocked into harry as they hurried past him eosstop it was hermione eosstop harry caught a glimpse of her face and was startled to see that she was in tears eosstop i think she heard you eosstop endquote so eosquestion endquote said ron but he looked a bit uncomfortable eosstop startquote she must have noticed she is got no friends eosstop endquote hermione did not turn up for the next class and was not seen all afternoon eosstop on their way down to the great hall for the halloween feast harry and ron overheard parvati patil telling her friend lavender that hermione was crying in the girls bathroom and wanted to be left alone eosstop ron looked still more awkward at this but a moment later they had entered the great hall where the halloween decorations put hermione out of their minds eosstop a thousand live bats fluttered from the walls and ceiling while a thousand more swooped over the tables in low black clouds making the candles in the pumpkins stutter eosstop the feast appeared suddenly on the golden plates as it had at the startofterm banquet eosstop harry was just helping himself to a baked potato when professor quirrell came sprinting into the hall his turban askew and terror on his face eosstop everyone stared as he reached professor dumbledore is chair slumped against the table and gasped startquote troll in the dungeons thought you ought to know eosstop endquote he then sank to the floor in a dead faint eosstop there was an uproar eosstop it took several purple firecrackers exploding from the end of professor dumbledore is wand to bring silence eosstop prefects endquote he rumbled startquote lead your houses back to the dormitories immediately eosexclamation endquote percy was in his element eosstop follow me eosexclamation stick together first years eosexclamation no need to fear the troll if you follow my orders eosexclamation stay close behind me now eosstop make way first years coming through eosexclamation excuse me i am a prefect eosexclamation endquote how could a troll get in eosquestion endquote harry asked as they climbed the stairs eosstop do not ask me they are supposed to be really stupid endquote said ron eosstop startquote maybe peeves let it in for a halloween joke eosstop endquote they passed different groups of people hurrying in different directions eosstop as they jostled their way through a crowd of confused hufflepuffs harry suddenly grabbed ron is arm eosstop i have just thought hermione eosstop endquote what about her eosquestion endquote she does not know about the troll eosstop endquote ron bit his lip eosstop oh all right endquote he snapped eosstop startquote but percy would better not see us eosstop endquote ducking down they joined the hufflepuffs going the other way slipped down a deserted side corridor and hurried off toward the girls bathroom eosstop they had just turned the corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them eosstop percy eosexclamation endquote hissed ron pulling harry behind a large stone griffin eosstop peering around it however they saw not percy but snape eosstop he crossed the corridor and disappeared from view eosstop what is he doing eosquestion endquote harry whispered eosstop startquote why is not he down in the dungeons with the rest of the teachers eosquestion endquote search me eosstop endquote quietly as possible they crept along the next corridor after snape is fading footsteps eosstop he is heading for the third floor endquote harry said but ron held up his hand eosstop can you smell something eosquestion endquote harry sniffed and a foul stench reached his nostrils a mixture of old socks and the kind of public toilet no one seems to clean eosstop and then they heard it a low grunting and the shuffling footfalls of gigantic feet eosstop ron pointed at the end of a passage to the left something huge was moving toward them eosstop they shrank into the shadows and watched as it emerged into a patch of moonlight eosstop it was a horrible sight eosstop twelve feet tall its skin was a dull granite gray its great lumpy body like a boulder with its small bald head perched on top like a coconut eosstop it had short legs thick as tree trunks with flat horny feet eosstop the smell coming from it was incredible eosstop it was holding a huge wooden club which dragged along the floor because its arms were so long eosstop the troll stopped next to a doorway and peered inside eosstop it waggled its long ears making up its tiny mind then slouched slowly into the room eosstop the keys in the lock endquote harry muttered eosstop startquote we could lock it in eosstop endquote good idea endquote said ron nervously eosstop they edged toward the open door mouths dry praying the troll was not about to come out of it eosstop with one great leap harry managed to grab the key slam the door and lock it eosstop yes eosexclamation endquote flushed with their victory they started to run back up the passage but as they reached the corner they heard something that made their hearts stop a high petrified scream and it was coming from the chamber they would just chained up eosstop oh no endquote said ron pale as the bloody baron eosstop it is the girls bathroom eosexclamation endquote harry gasped eosstop hermione eosexclamation endquote they said together eosstop it was the last thing they wanted to do but what choice did they have eosquestion wheeling around they sprinted back to the door and turned the key fumbling in their panic eosstop harry pulled the door open and they ran inside eosstop hermione granger was shrinking against the wall opposite looking as if she was about to faint eosstop the troll was advancing on her knocking the sinks off the walls as it went eosstop confuse it eosexclamation endquote harry said desperately to ron and seizing a tap he threw it as hard as he could against the wall eosstop the troll stopped a few feet from hermione eosstop it lumbered around blinking stupidly to see what had made the noise eosstop its mean little eyes saw harry eosstop it hesitated then made for him instead lifting its club as it went eosstop oy peabrain eosexclamation endquote yelled ron from the other side of the chamber and he threw a metal pipe at it eosstop the troll did not even seem to notice the pipe hitting its shoulder but it heard the yell and paused again turning its ugly snout toward ron instead giving harry time to run around it eosstop come on run run eosexclamation endquote harry yelled at hermione trying to pull her toward the door but she could not move she was still flat against the wall her mouth open with terror eosstop the shouting and the echoes seemed to be driving the troll berserk eosstop it roared again and started toward ron who was nearest and had no way to escape eosstop harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid he took a great running jump and managed to fasten his arms around the troll is neck from behind eosstop the troll could not feel harry hanging there but even a troll will notice if you stick a long bit of wood up its nose and harry is wand had still been in his hand when he would jumped it had gone straight up one of the troll is nostrils eosstop howling with pain the troll twisted and flailed its club with harry clinging on for dear life any second the troll was going to rip him off or catch him a terrible blow with the club eosstop hermione had sunk to the floor in fright ron pulled out his own wand not knowing what he was going to do he heard himself cry the first spell that came into his head startquote wingardium leviosa eosexclamation endquote the club flew suddenly out of the troll is hand rose high high up into the air turned slowly over and dropped with a sickening crack onto its owner is head eosstop the troll

on saturday harry would be playing in his first match after weeks of training gryffindor versus slytherin eosstop if gryffindor won they would move up into second place in the house championship eosstop hardly anyone had seen harry play because wood had decided that as their secret weapon harry should be kept well secret eosstop but the news that he was playing seeker had leaked out somehow and harry did not know which was worse people telling him he would be brilliant or people telling him they would be running around underneath him holding a mattress eosstop it was really lucky that harry now had hermlone as a friend eosstop he did not know how he would have gotten through all his homework without her what with all the lastminute quidditch practice wood was making them do eosstop she had also tent him quidditch through the ages which turned out to be a very interesting read eosstop harry learned that there were seven hundred ways of committing a quidditch foul and that all of them had happened during a world cup match in 1473 that seekers were usually the smallest and fastest players and that most serious quidditch accidents seemed to happen to them that although people rarely died playing quidditch referees had been known to vanish and turn up months later in the sahara desert eosstop hermione had become a bit more relaxed about breaking rules since harry and ron had saved her from the mountain troll and she was much nicer for it eosstop the day before harry is first quidditch match the three of them were out in the freezing courtyard during break and she had conjured them up a bright blue fire that could be carried around in a jam jar eosstop they were standing with their backs to it getting warm when snape crossed the yard eosstop harry noticed at once that snape was limping eosstop harry ron and hermione moved closer together to block the fire from view they were sure it would not be allowed eosstop unfortunately something about their guilty faces caught snape is eye eosstop he limped over eosstop he had not seen the fire but he seemed to be looking for a reason to tell them off anyway eosstop what is that you have got there potter eosquestion endquote it was quidditch through the ages eosstop harry showed him eosstop library books are not to be taken outside the school endquote said snape eosstop give it to me eosstop five points from gryffindor eosstop endquote he is just made that rule up endquote harry muttered angrily as snape limped away eosstop startquote wonder what is wrong with his leg eosquestion endquote dunno but i hope it is really hurting him endquote said ron bitterly eosstop the gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening eosstop harry ron and hermione sat together next to a window eosstop hermione was checking harry and ron is charms homework for them eosstop she would never let them copy how will you learn eosquestion but by asking her to read it through they got the right answers anyway eosstop harry felt restless eosstop he wanted quidditch through the ages back to take his mind off his nerves about tomorrow eosstop why should he be afraid of snape eosquestion getting up he told ron and hermione he was going to ask snape if he could have it eosstop better you than me endquote they said together but harry had an idea that snape would not refuse if there were other teachers listening eosstop he made his way down to the staffroom and knocked eosstop there was no answer eosstop he knocked again eosstop nothing eosstop perhaps snape had left the book in there eosquestion it was worth a try eosstop he pushed the door ajar and peered inside and a horrible scene met his eyes eosstop snape and filch were inside alone eosstop snape was holding his robes above his knees eosstop one of his legs was bloody and mangled eosstop filch was handing snape bandages eosstop blasted thing endquote snape was saying eosstop startquote how are you supposed to keep your eyes on all three heads at once eosquestion endquote harry tried to shut the door quietly but startquote potter eosexclamation endquote snape is face was twisted with fury as he dropped his robes quickly to hide his leg eosstop harry gulped eosstop i just wondered if i could have my book back eosstop endquote get out eosexclamation out eosexclamation endquote harry left before snape could take any more points from gryffindor eosstop he sprinted back upstairs eosstop did you get it eosquestion endquote ron asked as harry joined them eosstop startquote what is the matter eosquestion endquote in a low whisper harry told them what he would seen eosstop you know what this means eosquestion endquote he finished breathlessly eosstop startquote he tried to get past that threeheaded dog at halloween eosexclamation that is where he was going when we saw him he is after whatever it is guarding eosexclamation and id bet my broomstick he let that troll in to make a diversion eosexclamation endquote hermione is eyes were wide eosstop no he would not she said eosstop startquote i know he is not very nice but he would not try and steal something dumbledore was keeping safe eosstop endquote honestly hermione you think all teachers are saints or something endquote snapped ron eosstop startquote i am with harry eosstop i would not put anything past snape eosstop but what is he after eosquestion what is that dog guarding eosquestion endquote harry went to bed with his head buzzing with the same question eosstop neville was snoring loudly but harry could not sleep eosstop he tried to empty his mind he needed to sleep he had to he had his first quidditch match in a few hours but the expression on snape is face when harry had seen his leg was not easy to forget eosstop the next morning dawned very bright and cold eosstop the great hall was full of the delicious smell of fried sausages and the cheer ful chatter of everyone looking forward to a good quidditch match eosstop you have got to eat some breakfast eosstop endquote i do not want anything eosstop endquote just a bit of toast endquote wheedled hermione eosstop i am not hungry eosstop endquote harry felt terrible eosstop in an hour is time he would be walking onto the field eosstop harry you need your strength endquote said seamus finnigan eosstop startquote seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team eosstop endquote thanks seamus endquote said harry watching seamus pile ketchup on his sausages eosstop by eleven oclock the whole school seemed to be out in the stands around the quidditch pitch eosstop many students had binoculars eosstop the seats might be raised high in the air but it was still difficult to see what was going on sometimes eosstop ron and hermione joined neville seamus and dean the west ham fan up in the top row eosstop as a surprise for harry they had painted a large banner on one of the sheets scabbers had ruined eosstop it said potter for president and dean who was good at drawing had done a large gryffindor lion underneath eosstop then hermione had performed a tricky little charm so that the paint flashed different colors eosstop meanwhile in the locker room harry and the rest of the team were changing into their scarlet quidditch robes slytherin would be playing in green eosstop wood cleared his throat for silence eosstop okay men endquote he said eosstop and women endquote said chaser angelina johnson eosstop and women endquote wood agreed eosstop startquote this is it eosstop endquote the big one endquote said fred weasley eosstop the one we have all been waiting for endquote said george eosstop we know oliver is speech by heart endquote fred told harry startquote we were on the team last year eosstop endquote shut up you two endquote said wood eosstop startquote this is the best team gryffindor is had in years eosstop we are going to win eosstop i know it eosstop endquote he glared at them all as if to say startquote or else eosstop endquote right eosstop it is time eosstop good luck all of you eosstop endquote harry followed fred and george out of the locker room and hoping his knees were not going to give way walked onto the field to loud cheers eosstop madam hooch was refereeing eosstop she stood in the middle of the field waiting for the two teams her broom in her hand eosstop now i want a nice fair game all of you endquote she said once they were all gathered around her eosstop harry noticed that she seemed to be speaking particularly to the slytherin captain marcus flint a sixth year eosstop harry thought flint looked as if he had some troll blood in him eosstop out of the corner of his eye he saw the fluttering banner high above flashing potter for president over the crowd eosstop his heart skipped eosstop he felt braver eosstop mount your brooms please eosstop endquote harry clambered onto his nimbus two thousand eosstop madam hooch gave a loud blast on her silver whistle eosstop fifteen brooms rose up high high into the air eosstop they were off eosstop startquote and the quaffle is taken immediately by angelina johnson of gryffindor what an excellent chaser that girl is and rather attractive too endquote jordan eosexclamation endquote sorry professor eosstop endquote the weasley twins friend lee jordan was doing the commentary for the match closely watched by professor mcgonagall eosstop and she is really belting along up there a neat pass to alicia spinnet a good find of oliver wood is last year only a reserve back to johnson and no the slytherins have taken the quaffle slytherin captain marcus flint gains the quaffle and off he goes flint flying like an eagle up there he is going to sc no stopped by an excellent move by gryffindor keeper wood and the gryffindors take the quaffle that is chaser katie bell of gryffindor there nice dive around flint off up the field and ouch that must have hurt hit in the back of the head by a bludger quaffle taken by the slytherins that is adrian pucey speeding off toward the goal posts but he is blocked by a second bludger sent his way by fred or george weasley can not tell which nice play by the gryffindor beater anyway and johnson back in possession of the quaffle a clear field ahead and off she goes she is really flying dodges a speeding bludger the goal posts are ahead come on now angelina keeper bletchley dives misses gryffindors score eosexclamation endquote gryffindor cheers filled the cold air with howls and moans from the slytherins eosstop budge up there move along eosstop endquote hagrid eosexclamation endquote ron and hermione squeezed together to give hagrid enough space to join them eosstop bin watchin from me hut endquote said hagrid patting a large pair of binoculars around his neck startquote but it is not the same as bein in the crowd eosstop no sign of the snitch yet eh eosquestion endquote nope endquote said ron eosstop startquote harry has not had much to do yet eosstop endquote kept outta trouble though that is somethin endquote said hagrid raising his binoculars and peering skyward at the speck that was harry eosstop way up above them harry was gliding over the game squinting about for some sign of the snitch eosstop this was part of his and wood is game plan eosstop keep out of the way until you catch sight of the snitch endquote wood had said eosstop startquote we do not want you attacked before you have to be eosstop endquote when angelina had scored harry had done a couple of looptheloops to let off his feelings eosstop now he was back to staring around for the snitch eosstop once he caught sight of a flash of gold but it was just a reflection from one of the weasleys wristwatches and once a bludger decided to come pelting his way more like a cannonball than anything but harry dodged it and fred weasley came chasing after it eosstop all right there harry eosquestion endquote he had time to yell as he beat the bludger furiously toward marcus flint eosstop slytherin in possession endquote lee jordan was saying startquote chaser pucey ducks two bludgers two weasleys and chaser bell and speeds toward the wait a moment was that the snitch eosquestion endquote a murmur ran through the crowd as adrian pucey dropped the quaffle too busy looking over his shoulder at the flash of gold that had passed his left ear eosstop harry saw it eosstop in a great rush of excitement he dived downward after the streak of gold eosstop slytherin seeker terence higgs had seen it too eosstop neck and neck they hurtled toward the snitch all the chasers seemed to have forgotten what they were supposed to be doing as they hung in midair to watch eosstop harry was faster than higgs he could see the little round ball wings fluttering darting up ahead he put on an extra spurt of speed wham eosexclamation a roar of rage echoed from the gryffindors below marcus flint had blocked harry on purpose and harry is broom spun off course harry holding on for dear life eosstop foul eosexclamation endquote screamed the gryffindors eosstop madam hooch spoke angrily to flint and then ordered a free shot at the goal posts for gryffindor eosstop but in all the confusion of course the golden snitch had disappeared from sight again eosstop down in the stands dean thomas was yelling startquote send him off ref eosexclamation red card eosexclamation endquote what are you talking about dean eosquestion endquote said ron eosstop red card eosexclamation endquote said dean furiously eosstop startquote in soccer you get shown the red card and you are out of the game eosexclamation endquote but this is not soccer dean endquote ron reminded him eosstop hagrid however was on dean is side eosstop they oughta change the rules eosstop flint coulda knocked harry outta the air eosstop endquote lee jordan was finding it difficult not to take sides eosstop so after that obvious and disgusting bit of cheating startquote jordan eosexclamation endquote growled professor mcgonagall eosstop i mean after that open and revolting foul jordan i am warning you endquote all right all right eosstop flint nearly kills the gryffindor seeker which could happen to anyone i am sure so a penalty to gryffindor taken by spinner who puts it away no trouble and we continue play gryffindor still in possession eosstop endquote it was as harry dodged another bludger which went spinning dangerously past his head that it happened eosstop his broom gave a sudden frightening lurch eosstop for a split second he thought he was going to fall eosstop he gripped the broom tightly with both his hands and knees eosstop he would never felt anything like that eosstop it happened again eosstop it was as though the broom was trying to buck him off eosstop but nimbus two thousands did not suddenly decide to buck their riders off eosstop harry tried to turn back toward the gryffindor goal posts he had half a mind to ask wood to call timeout and then he realized that his broom was completely out of his control eosstop he could not turn it eosstop he could not direct it at all eosstop it was zigzagging through the air and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him eosstop lee was still commentating eosstop slytherin in possession flint with the quaffle passes spinnet passes bell hit hard in the face by a bludger hope it broke his nose only joking professor slytherins score a no eosstop the slytherins were cheering eosstop no one seemed to have noticed that harry is broom was behaving strangely eosstop it was carrying him slowly higher away from the game jerking and twitching as it went eosstop dunno what harry thinks he is doing endquote hagrid mumbled eosstop he stared through his binoculars eosstop startquote if i didn know better i would say he would lost control of his broom eosstop but he can not have eosstop eosstop endquote suddenly people were pointing up at harry all over the stands eosstop his broom had started to roll over and over with him only just managing to hold on eosstop then the whole crowd gasped eosstop harry is broom had given a wild jerk and harry swung off it eosstop he was now dangling from it holding on with only one hand eosstop did something happen to it when flint blocked him eosquestion endquote seamus whispered eosstop ca not have endquote hagrid said his voice shaking eosstop startquote ca not nothing interfere with a broomstick except powerful dark magic no kid could do that to a nimbus two thousand eosstop endquote at these words hermione seized hagrid is binoculars but instead of looking up at harry she started looking frantically at the crowd eosstop what are you doing eosquestion endquote moaned ron grayfaced eosstop i knew it endquote hermione gasped startquote snape look eosstop endquote ron grabbed the binoculars eosstop snape was in the middle of the stands opposite them eosstop he had his eyes fixed on harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath eosstop he is doing something jinxing the broom endquote said hermione eosstop what should we do eosquestion endquote leave it to me eosstop endquote before ron could say another word hermione had disappeared eosstop ron turned the binoculars back on harry eosstop his broom was vibrating so hard it was almost impossible for him to hang on much longer eosstop the whole crowd was on its feet watching terrified as the weasleys flew up to try and pull harry safely onto one of their brooms but it was no good every time they got near him the broom would jump higher still eosstop they dropped lower and circled beneath him obviously hoping to catch him if he fell eosstop marcus flint seized the quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing eosstop come on hermione endquote ron muttered desperately eosstop hermione had fought her way across to the stand where snape stood and was now racing along the row behind him she did not even stop to say sorry as she knocked professor quirrell headfirst into the row in front eosstop reaching snape she crouched down pulled out her wand and whispered a few well chosen words eosstop bright blue flames shot from her wand onto the hem of snape is robes eosstop it took perhaps thirty seconds for snape to realize that he was on fire eosstop a sudden yelp told her she had done her job eosstop scooping the fire off him into a little jar in her pocket she scrambled back along the row snape would never know what had happened eosstop it was enough eosstop up in the air harry was suddenly able to clamber back on to his broom eosstop neville you can look eosexclamation endquote ron said eosstop neville had been sobbing into hagrid is jacket for the last five minutes eosstop harry was speeding toward the ground when the crowd saw him clap his hand to his mouth as though he was about to be sick he hit the field on all fours coughed and something gold fell into his hand eosstop i have got the snitch eosexclamation endquote he shouted waving it above his head and the game ended in complete confusion eosstop he did not catch it he nearly swallowed it endquote flint was still howling twenty minutes later but it made no difference harry had not broken any rules and lee jordan was still happily shouting the results gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points to sixty eosstop harry heard none of this though eosstop he was being made a cup of strong tea back in hagrid is hut with ron and hermione eosstop it was snape endquote ron was explaining startquote hermione and i saw him eosstop he was cursing your broomstick muttering he would not take his eyes off you eosstop endquote rubbish endquote said hagrid who had not heard a word of what had gone on next to him in the stands eosstop startquote why would snape do somethin like that eosquestion endquote harry ron and hermione looked at one another wondering what to tell him eosstop harry decided on the truth eosstop i found out something about

eosexclamation endquote said harry startquote so there is someone called nicolas flamel involved is there eosquestion endquote hagrid looked furious with himself eosstop chapter twelve the mirror of erised christmas was coming eosstop one morning in middecember hogwarts woke to find itself covered in several feet of snow eosstop the lake froze solid and the weasley twins were punished for bewitching several snowballs so that they followed quirrell around bouncing off the back of his turban eosstop the few owls that managed to battle their way through the stormy sky to deliver mail had to be nursed back to health by hagrid before they could fly off again eosstop no one could wait for the holidays to start eosstop while the gryffindor common room and the great hall had roaring fires the drafty corridors had become icy and a bitter wind rattled the windows in the classrooms eosstop worst of all were professor snape is classes down in the dungeons where their breath rose in a mist before them and they kept as close as possible to their hot cauldrons eosstop i do feel so sorry endquote said draco malfoy one potions class startquote for all those people who have to stay at hogwarts for christmas because they are not wanted at home eosstop endquote he was looking over at harry as he spoke eosstop crabbe and goyle chuckled eosstop harry who was measuring out powdered spine of lionfish ignored them eosstop malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since the quidditch match eosstop disgusted that the slytherins had lost he had tried to get everyone laughing at how a widemouthed tree frog would be replacing harry as seeker next eosstop then he would realized that nobody found this funny because they were all so impressed at the way harry had managed to stay on his bucking broomstick eosstop so malfoy jealous and angry had gone back to taunting harry about having no proper family eosstop it was true that harry was not going back to privet drive for christmas eosstop professor mcgonagall had come around the week before making a list of students who would be staying for the holidays and harry had signed up at once eosstop he did not feel sorry for himself at all this would probably be the best christmas he would ever had eosstop ron and his brothers were staying too because mr eosstop and mrs eosstop weasley were going to romania to visit charlie eosstop when they left the dungeons at the end of potions they found a large fir tree blocking the corridor ahead eosstop two enormous feet sticking out at the bottom and a loud puffing sound told them that hagrid was behind it eosstop hi hagrid want any help eosquestion endquote ron asked sticking his head through the branches eosstop nah i am all right thanks ron eosstop endquote would you mind moving out of the way eosquestion endquote came malfoys cold drawl from behind them eosstop startquote are you trying to earn some extra money weasley eosquestion hoping to be gamekeeper yourself when you leave hogwarts i suppose that hut of hagrid is must seem like a palace compared to what your family is used to eosstop endquote ron dived at malfoy just as snape came up the stairs eosstop weasley eosexclamation endquote ron let go of the front of malfoy is robes eosstop he was provoked professor snape endquote said hagrid sticking his huge hairy face out from behind the tree eosstop startquote malfoy was insultin his family eosstop endquote be that as it may fighting is against hogwarts rules hagrid endquote said snape silkily eosstop startquote five points from gryffindor weasley and be grateful it is not more eosstop move along all of you eosstop endquote malfoy crabbe and goyle pushed roughly past the tree scattering needles everywhere and smirking eosstop i will get him endquote said ron grinding his teeth at malfoy is back startquote one of these days i will get him endquote i hate them both endquote said harry startquote malfoy and snape eosstop endquote come on cheer up it is nearly christmas endquote said hagrid eosstop startquote tell yeh what come with me an see the great hall looks a treat eosstop endquote so the three of them followed hagrid and his tree off to the great hall where professor mcgonagall and professor flitwick were busy with the christmas decorations eosstop ah hagrid the last tree put it in the far corner would you eosquestion endquote the hall looked spectacular eosstop festoons of holly and mistletoe hung all around the walls and no less than twelve towering christmas trees stood around the room some sparkling with tiny icicles some glittering with hundreds of candles eosstop how many days you got left until yer holidays eosquestion endquote hagrid asked eosstop just one endquote said hermione eosstop startquote and that reminds me harry ron we have got half an hour before lunch we should be in the library eosstop endquote oh yeah you are right endquote said ron tearing his eyes away from professor flitwick who had golden bubbles blossoming out of his wand and was trailing them over the branches of the new tree eosstop the library eosquestion endquote said hagrid following them out of the hall eosstop startquote just before the holidays eosquestion bit keen are not yeh eosquestion endquote oh we are not working endquote harry told him brightly eosstop startquote ever since you mentioned nicolas flamel we have been trying to find out who he is eosstop endquote you what eosquestion endquote hagrid looked shocked eosstop startquote listen here i have told yeh drop it eosstop it is nothin to you what that dog is guardin eosstop endquote we just want to know who nicolas flamel is that is all endquote said hermione eosstop unless you would like to tell us and save us the trouble eosquestion endquote harry added eosstop startquote we must have been through hundreds of books already and we can not find him anywhere just give us a hint i know i have read his name somewhere eosstop endquote i am sayin nothin said hagrid flatly eosstop just have to find out for ourselves then endquote said ron and they left hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off to the library eosstop they had indeed been searching books for flamel is name ever since hagrid had let it slip because how else were they going to find out what snape was trying to steal eosquestion the trouble was it was very hard to know where to begin not knowing what flamel might have done to get himself into a book eosstop he was not in great wizards of the twentieth century or notable magical names of our time he was missing too from important modern magical discoveries and a study of recent developments in wizardry eosstop and then of course there was the sheer size of the library tens of thousands of books thousands of shelves hundreds of narrow rows eosstop hermione took out a list of subjects and titles she had decided to search while ron strode off down a row of books and started pulling them off the shelves at random eosstop harry wandered over to the restricted section eosstop he had been wondering for a while if flamel was not somewhere in there eosstop unfortunately you needed a specially signed note from one of the teachers to look in any of the restricted books and he knew he would never get one eosstop these were the books containing powerful dark magic never taught at hogwarts and only read by older students studying advanced defense against the dark arts eosstop what are you looking for boy eosquestion endquote nothing endquote said harry eosstop madam pince the librarian brandished a feather duster at him eosstop you would better get out then eosstop go on out eosexclamation endquote wishing he would been a bit quicker at thinking up some story harry left the library eosstop he ron and hermione had already agreed they would better not ask madam pince where they could find flamel eosstop they were sure she would be able to tell them but they could not risk snape hearing what they were up to eosstop harry waited outside in the corridor to see if the other two had found anything but he was not very hopeful eosstop they had been looking for two weeks after a but as they only had odd moments between lessons it was not surprising they would found nothing eosstop what they really needed was a nice long search without madam pince breathing down their necks eosstop five minutes later ron and hermione joined him shaking their heads eosstop they went off to lunch eosstop you will keep looking while i am away will not you eosquestion endquote said hermione eosstop startquote and send me an owl if you find anything eosstop endquote and you could ask your parents if they know who flamel is endquote said ron eosstop it would be safe to ask them eosstop endquote very safe as they are both dentists endquote said hermione eosstop once the holidays had started ron and harry were having too good a time to think much about flamel eosstop they had the dormitory to themselves and the common room was far emptier than usual so they were able to get the good armchairs by the fire eosstop they sat by the hour eating anything they could spear on a toasting fork bread english muffins marshmallows and plotting ways of getting malfoy expelled which were fun to talk about even if they would not work eosstop ron also started teaching harry wizard chess eosstop this was exactly like muggle chess except that the figures were alive which made it a lot like directing troops in battle eosstop ron is set was very old and battered eosstop like everything else he owned it had once belonged to someone else in his family in this case his grandfather eosstop however old chessmen were not a drawback at all eosstop ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them to do what he wanted eosstop harry played with chessmen seamus finnigan had lent him and they did not trust him at all eosstop he was not a very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits of advice at him which was confusing eosstop startquote do not send me there can not you see his knight eosquestion send him we can afford to lose him eosstop endquote on christmas eve harry went to bed looking forward to the next day for the food and the fun but not expecting any presents at all eosstop when he woke early in the morning however the first thing he saw was a small pile of packages at the foot of his bed eosstop merry christmas endquote said ron sleepily as harry scrambled out of bed and pulled on his bathrobe eosstop you too endquote said harry eosstop startquote will you look at this eosquestion i have got some presents eosexclamation endquote what did you expect turnips eosquestion endquote said ron turning to his own pile which was a lot bigger than harry is eosstop harry picked up the top parcel eosstop it was wrapped in thick brown paper and scrawled across it was to harry from hagrid eosstop inside was a roughly cut wooden flute eosstop hagrid had obviously whittled it himself eosstop harry blew it it sounded a bit like an owl eosstop a second very small parcel contained a note eosstop we received your message and enclose your christmas present eosstop from uncle vernon and aunt petunia eosstop taped to the note was a fiftypence piece eosstop that is friendly endquote said harry eosstop ron was fascinated by the fifty pence eosstop weird eosexclamation endquote he said nmat a shape eosexclamation this is money eosquestion endquote you can keep it endquote said harry laughing at how pleased ron was eosstop startquote hagrid and my aunt and uncle so who sent these eosquestion endquote i think i know who that one is from endquote said ron turning a bit pink and pointing to a very lumpy parcel eosstop startquote my mom eosstop i told her you did not expect any presents and oh no endquote he groaned startquote she is made you a weasley sweater eosstop endquote harry had torn open the parcel to find a thick handknitted sweater in emerald green and a large box of homemade fudge eosstop every year she makes us a sweater endquote said ron unwrapping his own startquote and mine is always maroon eosstop endquote that is really nice of her endquote said harry trying the fudge which was very tasty eosstop his next present also contained candy a large box of chocolate frogs from hermione eosstop this only left one parcel eosstop harry picked it up and felt it eosstop it was very light eosstop he unwrapped it eosstop something fluid and silvery gray went slithering to the floor where it lay in gleaming folds eosstop ron gasped eosstop i have heard of those endquote he said in a hushed voice dropping the box of every flavor beans he would gotten from hermione eosstop startquote if that is what i think it is they are really rare and really valuable eosstop endquote what is it eosquestion endquote harry picked the shining silvery cloth off the floor eosstop it was strange to the touch like water woven into material eosstop it is an invisibility cloak endquote said ron a look of awe on his face eosstop startquote i am sure it is try it on eosstop endquote harry threw the cloak around his shoulders and ron gave a yell eosstop it is eosexclamation look down eosexclamation endquote harry looked down at his feet but they were gone eosstop he dashed to the mirror eosstop sure enough his reflection looked back at him just his head suspended in midair his body completely invisible eosstop he pulled the cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely eosstop there is a note eosexclamation endquote said ron suddenly eosstop startquote a note fell out of it eosexclamation endquote harry pulled off the cloak and seized the letter eosstop written in narrow loopy writing he had never seen before were the following words your father left this in my possession before he died eosstop it is time it was returned to you eosstop use it well eosstop a very merry christmas to you eosstop there was no signature eosstop harry stared at the note eosstop ron was admiring the cloak eosstop i would give anything for one of these endquote he said eosstop startquote anything eosstop what is the matter eosquestion endquote nothing endquote said harry eosstop he felt very strange eosstop who had sent the cloak eosquestion had it really once belonged to his father eosquestion before he could say or think anything else the dormitory door was flung open and fred and george weasley bounded in eosstop harry stuffed the cloak quickly out of sight eosstop he did not feel like sharing it with anyone else yet eosstop merry christmas eosexclamation endquote hey look harry is got a weasley sweater too eosexclamation endquote fred and george were wearing blue sweaters one with a large yellow f on it the other a g eosstop harry is is better than ours though endquote said fred holding up harry is sweater eosstop startquote she obviously makes more of an effort if you are not family eosstop endquote why are not you wearing yours ron eosquestion endquote george demanded eosstop startquote come on get it on they are lovely and warm eosstop endquote i hate maroon endquote ron moaned halfheartedly as he pulled it over his head eosstop you have not got a letter on yours endquote george observed eosstop startquote i suppose she thinks you do not forget your name eosstop but we are not stupid we know we are called gred and forge eosstop endquote what is all th is noise eosstop percy weasley stuck his head through the door looking disapproving eosstop he had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents as he too carried a lumpy sweater over his arm which fred seized eosstop p for prefect eosexclamation get it on percy come on we are all wearing ours even harry got one eosstop endquote i do not want said percy thickly as the twins forced the sweater over his head knocking his glasses askew eosstop and you are not sitting with the prefects today either endquote said george eosstop startquote christmas is a time for family eosstop endquote they frogmarched percy from the room his arms pinned to his side by his sweater eosstop harry had never in all his life had such a christmas dinner eosstop a hundred fat roast turkeys mountains of roast and boiled potatoes platters of chipolatas tureens of buttered peas silver boats of thick rich gravy and cranberry sauce and stacks of wizard crackers every few feet along the table eosstop these fantastic party favors were nothing like the feeble muggle ones the dursleys usually bought with their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside eosstop harry pulled a wizard cracker with fred and it did not just bang it went off with a blast like a cannon and engulfed them all in a cloud of blue smoke while from the inside exploded a rear admiral is hat and several live white mice eosstop up at the high table dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard is hat for a flowered bonnet and was chuckling merrily at a joke professor flitwick had just read him eosstop flaming christmas puddings followed the turkey eosstop percy nearly broke his teeth on a silver sickle embedded in his slice eosstop harry watched hagrid getting redder and redder in the face as he called for more wine finally kissing professor mcgonagall on the cheek who to harry is amazement giggled and blushed her top hat lopsided eosstop when harry finally left the table he was laden down with a stack of things out of the crackers including a pack of nonexplodable luminous balloons a growyourownwarts kit and his own new wizard chess set eosstop the white mice had disappeared and harry had a nasty feeling they were going to end up as mrs eosstop norris is christmas dinner eosstop harry and the weasleys spent a happy afternoon having a furious snowball fight on the grounds eosstop then cold wet and gasping for breath they returned to the fire in the gryffindor common room where harry broke in his new chess set by losing spectacularly to ron eosstop he suspected he would not have lost so badly if percy had not tried to help him so much eosstop after a meal of turkey sandwiches crumpets trifle and christmas cake everyone felt too full and sleepy to do much before bed except sit and watch percy chase fred and george all over gryffindor tower because they would stolen his prefect badge eosstop it had been harry is best christmas day ever eosstop yet something had been nagging at the back of his mind all day eosstop not until he climbed into bed was he free to think about it the invisibility cloak and whoever had sent it eosstop ron full of turkey and cake and with nothing mysterious to bother him fell asleep almost as soon as he would drawn the curtains of his fourposter eosstop harry leaned over the side of his own bed and pulled the cloak out from under it eosstop his father is eosstop this had been his father is eosstop he let the material flow over his hands smoother than silk light as air eosstop use it well the note had said eosstop he had to try it now eosstop he slipped out of bed and wrapped the cloak around himself eosstop looking down at his legs he saw only moonlight and shadows eosstop it was a very funny feeling eosstop use it well eosstop suddenly harry felt wideawake eosstop the whole of hogwarts was open to him in this cloak eosstop excitement flooded through him as he stood there in the dark and silence eosstop he could go anywhere in this anywhere and filch would never know eosstop ron grunted in his sleep eosstop should harry wake him eosquestion something held him back his father is cloak he felt that this time the first time he wanted to use it alone eosstop he crept out of the dormitory down the stairs across the common room and climbed through the portrait hole eosstop who is there eosquestion endquote squawked the fat lady eosstop harry said nothing eosstop he walked quickly down the corridor eosstop where should he go eosquestion he stopped his heart racing and thought eosstop and then it came to him eosstop the restricted section in the library eosstop he would be able to read as long as he liked as long as it took to find out who flamel was eosstop he set off drawing the invisibility cloak tight around him as he walked eosstop the library was pitchblack and very eerie eosstop harry lit a lamp to see his way along the rows of books eosstop the lamp looked as if it was floating along in midair and even though harry could feel his arm supporting it the sight gave him the creeps eosstop the restricted section was right at the back of the library eosstop step ping carefully over the rope that separated these books from the rest of the library he held up his lamp to read the titles eosstop they did not tell him much eosstop their peeling faded gold letters spelled words in languages harry could not understand eosstop some had no title at all eosstop one book had a dark stain on it that looked horribly like blood eosstop the hairs on the back of harry is neck prickled eosstop maybe he was imagining it maybe not but he thought a faint whispering was coming from the books as though they knew someone was there who should not be eosstop he had to start somewhere eosstop setting the lamp down carefully on the floor he looked along the bottom shelf for an interestinglooking book eosstop a large black and silver volume caught his eye eosstop he pulled it out with difficulty because it was very heavy and balancing it on his knee let it fall open eosstop a piercing bloodcurdling shriek split the silence the book was screaming eosexclamation harry snapped it shut but the shriek went on and on one high unbroken earsplitting note eosstop he stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp which went out at once eosstop panicking he heard footsteps coming down the corridor outside stuffing the shrieking book back on the shelf he ran for it eosstop he passed filch in the doorway filch is pale wild eyes looked straight through him and harry slipped under filch is outstretched arm and streaked off up the corridor the book is shrieks still ringing in his ears eosstop he came to a sudden halt in front of a tall suit of armor eosstop he had been so busy getting away from the library he had not paid attention to where he was going eosstop perhaps because it was dark he did not recognize where he was at all eosstop there was a suit of armor near the kitchens he knew but he must be five floors above there eosstop you asked me to come directly to you professor if anyone was wandering around at night and somebody is been in the library restricted section eosstop endquote harry felt the blood drain out of his face eosstop wherever he was filch must know a shortcut because his soft greasy voice was getting nearer and to his horror it was snape who replied startquote the restricted section eosquestion well they can not be far we will catch them eosstop endquote harry stood rooted to the spot as filch and snape came around the corner ahead eosstop they could not see him of course but it was a narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they would knock right into him the cloak did not stop him from being solid eosstop he backed away as quietly as he could eosstop a door stood ajar to his left eosstop it was his only hope eosstop he squeezed through it holding his breath trying not to move it and to his relief he managed to get inside the room without their noticing anything eosstop they walked straight past and harry leaned against the wall breathing deeply listening to their footsteps dying away eosstop that had been close very close eosstop it was a few seconds before he noticed anything about the room he had hidden in eosstop it looked like an unused classroom eosstop the dark shapes of desks and chairs were piled against the walls and there was an upturned wastepaper basket but propped against the wall facing him was something that did not look as if it belonged there something that looked as if someone had just put it there to keep it out of the way eosstop it was a magnificent mirror as high as the ceiling with an ornate gold frame standing on two clawed feet eosstop there was an inscription carved around the top erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt on wohsi eosstop his panic fading now that there was no sound of filch and snape harry moved nearer to the mirror wanting to look at himself but see no reflection again eosstop he stepped in front of it eosstop he had to clap his hands to his mouth to stop himself from screaming eosstop he whirled around eosstop his heart was pounding far more furiously than when the book had screamed for he had seen not only himself in the mirror but a whole crowd of people standing right behind him eosstop but the room was empty eosstop breathing very fast he turned slowly back to the mirror eosstop there he was reflected in it white and scaredlooking and there reflected behind him were at least ten others eosstop harry looked over his shoulder but still no one was there eosstop or were they all invisible too eosquestion was he in fact in a room full of invisible people and this mirror is trick was that it reflected them invisible or not eosquestion he looked in the mirror again eosstop a woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling at him and waving eosstop he reached out a hand and felt the air behind him eosstop if she was really there he would touch her their reflections were so close together but he felt only air she and the others existed only in the mirror eosstop she was a very pretty woman eosstop she had dark red hair and her eyes her eyes are just like mine harry thought edging a little closer to the glass eosstop bright green exactly the same shape but then he noticed that she was crying smiling but crying at the same time eosstop the tall thin blackhaired man standing next to her put his arm around her eosstop he wore glasses and his hair was very untidy eosstop it stuck up at the back just as harry is did eosstop harry was so close to the mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that of his reflection eosstop mom eosquestion endquote he whispered eosstop startquote dad eosquestion endquote they just looked at him smiling eosstop and slowly harry looked into the faces of the other people in the mirror and saw other pairs of green eyes like his other noses like his even a little old man who looked as though he had harry is knobbly knees harry was looking at his family for the first time in his life eosstop the potters smiled and waved at harry and he stared hungrily back at them his hands pressed flat against the glass as though he was hoping to fall right through it and reach them eosstop he had a powerful kind of ache inside him half joy half terrible sadness eosstop how long he stood there he did not know eosstop the reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until a distant noise brought him back to his senses eosstop he could not stay here he had to find his way back to bed eosstop he tore his eyes away from his mother is face whispered startquote i will come back endquote and hurried from the room eosstop you could have woken me up endquote said ron crossly eosstop you can come tonight i am going back i want to show you the mirror eosstop i would like to see your mom and dad endquote ron said

anything eosquestion endquote harry could not eat eosstop he had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight eosstop he had almost forgotten about flamel eosstop it did not seem very important anymore eosstop who cared what the three headed dog was guarding eosquestion what did it matter if snape stole it really eosquestion startquote are you all right eosquestion endquote said ron eosstop startquote you look odd eosstop endquote what harry feared most was that he might not be able to find the mirror room again eosstop with ron covered in the cloak too they had to walk much more slowly the next night eosstop they tried retracing harry is route from the library wandering around the dark passageways for nearly an hour eosstop i am freezing endquote said ron eosstop startquote let is forget it and go back eosstop endquote no eosexclamation endquote harry hissed eosstop i know it is here somewhere eosstop endquote they passed the ghost of a tall witch gliding in the opposite direction but saw no one else eosstop just as ron started moaning that his feet were dead with cold harry spotted the suit of armor eosstop it is here just here yes eosexclamation endquote they pushed the door open eosstop harry dropped the cloak from around his shoulders and ran to the mirror eosstop there they were eosstop his mother and father beamed at the sight of him eosstop see eosquestion endquote harry whispered eosstop i can not see anything eosstop endquote look eosexclamation look at them all eosstop there are loads of them eosstop eosstop endquote i can only see you eosstop endquote look in it properly go on stand where i am eosstop endquote harry stepped aside but with ron in front of the mirror he could not see his family anymore just ron in his paisley pajamas eosstop ron though was staring transfixed at his image eosstop look at me eosexclamation endquote he said eosstop can you see all your family standing around you eosquestion endquote no i am alone but i am different i look older and i am head boy eosexclamation endquote what eosquestion endquote i am i am wearing the badge like bill used to and i am holding the house cup and the

is interesting about that eosquestion i want to see my parents eosstop endquote do not push me endquote a sudden noise outside in the corridor put an end to their discussion eosstop they had not realized how loudly they had been talking eosstop quick eosexclamation endquote ron threw the cloak back over them as the luminous eyes of mrs eosstop norris came round the door eosstop ron and harry stood quite still both thinking the same thing did the cloak work on cats eosquestion after what seemed an age she turned and left eosstop this is not safe she might have gone for filch i bet she heard us eosstop come on eosstop endquote and ron pulled harry out of the room eosstop the snow still had not melted the next morning eosstop want to play chess harry eosquestion endquote said ron

endquote i am serious harry do not go eosstop endquote but harry only had one thought in his head which was to get back in front of the mirror and ron was not going to stop him eosstop that third night he found his way more quickly than before eosstop he was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise but he did not meet anyone eosstop and there were his mother and father smiling at him again and one of his grandfathers nodding happily eosstop harry sank down to sit on the floor in front of the mirror eosstop there was nothing to stop him from staying here all night with his family eosstop nothing at all eosstop except startquote so back again harry eosquestion endquote harry felt as though his insides had turned to ice eosstop he looked behind him eosstop sitting on one of the desks by the wall was none other than albus dumbledore eosstop harry must have walked straight past him so desperate to get to the mirror he had not noticed him eosstop endquote i did not see you sir eosstop endquote strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you endquote said dumbledore and harry was relieved to see that he was smiling eosstop so endquote said dumbledore slipping off the desk to sit on the floor with harry startquote you like hundreds before you have discovered the delights of the mirror of erised eosstop endquote i did not know it was called that sir eosstop endquote but i expect you have realized by now what it does eosquestion endquote it well it shows me my family endquote and it showed your friend ron himself as head boy eosstop endquote how did you know eosquestion endquote i do not need a cloak to become invisible endquote said dumbledore gently eosstop now can you think what the mirror of erised shows us all eosquestion endquote harry shook his head eosstop let me explain eosstop the happiest man on earth would be able to use the mirror of erised like a normal mirror that is he would look into it and see himself exactly as he is eosstop does that help eosquestion endquote harry thought eosstop then he said slowly startquote it shows us what we want eosstop whatever we want eosstop endquote yes and no endquote said dumbledore quietly eosstop startquote it shows us nothing more or less than the deepest most desperate desire of our hearts eosstop you who have never known your family see them standing around you eosstop ronald weasley who has always been overshadowed by his brothers sees himself standing alone the best of all of them eosstop however this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth eosstop men have wasted away before it entranced by what they have seen or been driven mad not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible eosstop the mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow harry and i ask you not to go looking for it again eosstop if you ever do run across it you will now be prepared eosstop it does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live remember that eosstop now why do not you put that admirable cloak back on and get off to bed eosquestion endquote harry stood up eosstop sir professor dumbledore eosquestion can i ask you something eosquestion endquote obviously you have just done so endquote dumbledore smiled eosstop startquote you may ask me one more thing however eosstop endquote what do you see when you look in the mirror eosquestion

christmas has come and gone and i did not get a single pair eosstop people will insist on giving me books eosstop endquote it was only when he was back in bed that it struck harry that dumbledore might not have been quite truthful eosstop but then he thought as he shoved scabbers off his pillow it had been quite a personal question eosstop chapter thirteen nicolas flamel dumbledore had convinced harry not to go looking for the mirror of erised again and for the rest of the christmas holidays the invisibility cloak stayed folded at the bottom of his trunk eosstop harry wished he could forget what he would seen in the mirror as easily but he could not eosstop he started having nightmares eosstop over and over again he dreamed about his parents disappearing in a flash of green light while a high voice cackled with laughter eosstop you see dumbledore was right that mirror could drive you mad endquote said ron when harry told him about these drearns eosstop hermione who came back the day before term started took a different view of things eosstop she was torn between horror at the idea of harry being out of bed roaming the school three nights in a row if filch had caught you eosexclamation and disappointment that he had not at least found out who nicolas flamel was eosstop they had almost given up hope of ever finding flamel in a li brary book even though harry was still sure he would read the name somewhere eosstop once term had started they were back to skimming through books for ten minutes during their breaks eosstop harry had even less time than the other two because quidditch practice had started again eosstop wood was working the team harder than ever eosstop even the endless rain that had replaced the snow could not dampen his spirits eosstop the weasleys complained that wood was becoming a fanatic but harry was on wood is side eosstop if they won their next match against hufflepuff they would overtake slytherin in the house championship for the first time in seven years eosstop quite apart from wanting to win harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training eosstop then during one particularly wet and muddy practice session wood gave the team a bit of bad news eosstop he would just gotten very angry with the weasleys who kept divebombing each other and pretending to fall off their brooms eosstop will you stop messing around eosexclamation endquote he yelled eosstop startquote that is exactly the sort of thing that will lose us the match eosexclamation snape is refereeing this time and he will be looking for any excuse to knock points off gryffindor eosexclamation endquote george weasley really did fall off his broom at these words eosstop snape is refereeing eosquestion endquote he spluttered through a mouthful of mud eosstop startquote when is he ever refereed a quidditch match eosquestion he is not going to be fair if we might overtake slytherin eosstop endquote the rest of the team landed next to george to complain too eosstop it is not my fault endquote said wood eosstop startquote we have just got to make sure we play a clean game so snape has not got an excuse to pick on us eosstop endquote which was all very well thought harry but he had another reason for not wanting snape near him while he was playing quidditch eosstop eosstop the rest of the team hung back to talk to one another as usual at the end of practice but harry headed straight back to the gryffindor common room where he found ron and hermione playing chess eosstop chess was the only thing hermione ever lost at something harry and ron thought was very good for her eosstop do not talk to me for a moment endquote said ron when harry sat down next to him startquote i need to concen endquote he caught sight of harry is face eosstop startquote what is the matter with you eosquestion you look terrible eosstop endquote speaking quietly so that no one else would hear harry told the other two about

hermione suggested eosstop really break your leg endquote said ron eosstop i can not endquote said harry eosstop startquote there is not a reserve seeker eosstop if i back out gryffindor can not play at all eosstop endquote at that moment neville toppled into the common room eosstop how he had managed to climb through the portrait hole was anyone is guess because his legs had been stuck together with what they recognized at once as the leglocker curse eosstop he must have had to bunny hop all the way up to gryffindor tower eosstop everyone fell over laughing except hermione who leapt up and performed the countercurse eosstop neville is legs sprang apart and he got to his feet trembling eosstop startquote what happened eosquestion endquote hermione asked him leading him over to sit with harry and ron eosstop malfoy endquote said neville shakily eosstop startquote i met him outside the library eosstop he said he would been looking for someone to practice that on eosstop endquote go to

easier eosstop endquote there is no need to tell me i am not brave enough to be in gryffindor malfoy is already done that endquote neville choked out eosstop harry felt in the pocket of his robes and pulled out a chocolate frog the very last one from the box hermione had given him for christmas eosstop he gave it to neville who looked as though he might cry eosstop you are worth twelve of malfoy endquote harry said eosstop startquote the sorting hat chose you for gryffindor did not it eosquestion and where is malfoy eosquestion in stinking slytherin eosstop endquote neville is lips twitched in a weak smile as he unwrapped the frog eosstop thanks harry eosstop i think i will go to bed eosstop eosstop dyou want the card you collect them do not you eosquestion endquote as neville walked away harry looked at the famous wizard card eosstop dumbledore again endquote he said startquote he was the first one i ever endquote he gasped eosstop he stared at the back of the card eosstop then

piece of homework eosstop stay there eosexclamation endquote she said and she sprinted up the stairs to the girls dormitories eosstop harry and ron barely had time to exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back an enormous old book in her arms eosstop i never thought to look in here eosexclamation endquote she whispered excitedly eosstop startquote i got this out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading eosstop endquote light eosquestion endquote said ron but hermione told him to be quiet until she would looked something up and started flicking frantically through the pages muttering to herself eosstop at last she found what she was looking for eosstop i knew it eosexclamation i knew it eosexclamation endquote are we allowed to speak yet eosquestion endquote said ron grumpily eosstop hermione ignored him eosstop nicolas flamel endquote she whispered dramatically startquote is the only known maker of the sorcerer is stone eosexclamation endquote this did not have quite the effect she would expected eosstop the what eosquestion endquote said harry and ron eosstop oh honestly do not you two read eosquestion look read that there eosstop endquote she pushed the book toward them and harry and ron read the ancient study of alchemy is concerned with making the sorcerer is stone a legendary substance with astonishing powers eosstop the stone will transform any metal into pure gold eosstop it also produces the elixir of life which will make the drinker immortal eosstop there have been many reports of the sorcerer is stone over the centuries but the only stone currently in existence belongs to mr eosstop nicolas flamel the noted alchemist and opera lover eosstop mr eosstop flamel who celebrated his six hundred and sixtyfifth birthday last year enjoys a quiet life in devon with his wife perenelle six hundred and fiftyeight eosstop see eosquestion endquote said hermione when harry and ron had finished eosstop startquote the dog must be guarding flamel is sorcerer is stone eosexclamation i bet he asked dumbledore to keep it safe for him because they are friends and he knew someone was after it that is why he wanted the stone moved out of gringotts eosexclamation endquote a stone that makes gold and stops you from ever dying eosexclamation endquote said harry eosstop startquote no wonder snape is after it eosexclamation anyone would want it eosstop endquote and no wonder we could not find flamel in that study of recent developments in wizardry endquote said ron eosstop startquote he is not exactly recent if he is six hundred and sixtyfive is he eosquestion endquote the next morning in defense against the dark arts while copying down different ways of treating werewolf bites harry and ron were still discussing what they would do with a sorcerer is stone if they had one eosstop it was not until ron said he would buy his own quidditch team that harry remembered about snape and the coming match eosstop i am going to play endquote he told ron and hermione eosstop startquote if i do not all the slytherins will think i am just too scared to face snape eosstop i will show them eosstop it will really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win eosstop endquote just as long as we are not wiping you off the field endquote said hermione eosstop as the match drew nearer however harry became more and more nervous whatever he told ron and hermione eosstop the rest of the team was not too calm either eosstop the idea of overtaking slytherin in the house championship was wonderful no one had done it for seven years but would they be allowed to with such a biased referee eosquestion harry did not know whether he was imagining it or not but he seemed to keep running into snape wherever he went eosstop at times he even wondered whether snape was following him trying to catch him on his own eosstop potions lessons were turning into a sort of weekly torture snape was so horrible to harry eosstop could snape possibly know they would found out about the sorcerer is stone eosquestion harry did not see how he could yet he sometimes had the horrible feeling that snape could read minds eosstop harry knew when they wished him good luck outside the locker rooms the next afternoon that ron and hermione were wondering whether they would ever see him alive again eosstop this was not what you would call comforting eosstop harry hardly heard a word of wood is pep talk as he pulled on his quidditch robes and picked up his nimbus two thousand eosstop ron and hermione meanwhile had found a place in the stands next to neville who could not understand why they looked so grim and worried or why they had both brought their wands to the match eosstop little did harry know that ron and hermione had been secretly practicing the leglocker curse eosstop they would gotten the idea from malfoy using it on neville and were ready to use it on snape if he showed any sign of wanting to hurt harry eosstop now do not forget it is locomotor mortis endquote hermione muttered as ron slipped his wand up his sleeve eosstop i know endquote ron snapped eosstop startquote do not nag eosstop endquote back in the locker

harry is heart did a somersault eosstop dumbledore eosquestion endquote he said dashing to the door to make sure eosstop fred was right eosstop there was no mistaking that silver beard eosstop harry could have laughed out loud with relief he was safe eosstop there was simply no way that snape would dare to try to hurt him if dumbledore was watching eosstop perhaps that was why snape was looking so angry as the teams marched onto the field something that ron noticed too eosstop i have never seen snape look so mean endquote he told hermione eosstop startquote look they are off ouch eosexclamation endquote someone had poked ron in the back of the head eosstop it was malfoy eosstop oh sorry weasley did not see you there eosstop endquote malfoy grinned broadly at crabbe and goyle eosstop wonder how long potter is going to stay on his broom this time eosquestion anyone want a bet eosquestion what about you weasley eosquestion endquote ron did not answer snape had just awarded hufflepuff a penalty because george weasley had hit a bludger at him eosstop hermione who had all her fingers crossed in her lap was squinting fixedly at harry who was circling the game like a hawk looking for the snitch eosstop you know how i think they choose people for the gryffindor team eosquestion endquote said malfoy loudly a few minutes later as snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty for no reason at all eosstop startquote it is people they feel sorry for eosstop see there is potter who is got no parents then there is the weasleys who have got no money you should be on the team longbottom you have got no brains eosstop endquote neville went bright red but turned in his seat to face malfoy eosstop i am worth twelve of you malfoy endquote he stammered eosstop malfoy crabbe and goyle howled with laughter but ron still not daring to take his eyes from the game said startquote you tell him neville eosstop endquote longbottom if brains were gold you would be poorer than weasley and that is saying something eosstop endquote ron is nerves were already stretched to the breaking point with anxiety about harry eosstop i am warning you malfoy one more word startquote ron eosexclamation endquote said hermione suddenly startquote harry endquote what eosquestion where eosquestion endquote harry had suddenly gone into a spectacular dive which drew gasps and cheers from the crowd eosstop hermione stood up her crossed fingers in her mouth as harry streaked toward the ground like a bullet eosstop you are in luck weasley potter is obviously spotted some money on the ground eosexclamation endquote said malfoy eosstop ron snapped eosstop before malfoy knew what was happening ron was on top of him wrestling him to the ground eosstop neville hesitated then clambered over the back of his seat to help eosstop come on harry eosexclamation endquote hermione screamed leaping onto her seat to watch as harry sped straight at snape she did not even notice malfoy and ron rolling around under her seat or the scuffles and yelps coming from the whirl of fists that was neville crabbe and goyle eosstop up in the air snape turned on his broomstick just in time to see something scarlet shoot past him missing him by inches the next second harry had pulled out of the dive his arm raised in triumph the snitch clasped in his hand eosstop the stands erupted it had to be a record no one could ever remember the snitch being caught so quickly eosstop ron eosexclamation ron eosexclamation where are you eosquestion the game is over eosexclamation harry is won eosexclamation we have won eosexclamation gryffindor is in the lead eosexclamation endquote shrieked hermione dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front eosstop harry jumped off his broom a foot from the ground eosstop he could not believe it eosstop he would done it the game was over it had barely lasted five minutes eosstop as gryffindors came spilling onto the field he saw snape land nearby whitefaced and tightlipped then harry felt a hand on his shoulder and looked up into dumbledore is smiling face eosstop well done endquote said dumbledore quietly so that only harry could hear eosstop nice to see you have not been brooding about that mirror eosstop been keeping busy eosstop excellent eosstop endquote snape spat bitterly on the ground eosstop harry

added in a whisper to harry startquote but he will have a harder time frightenin you an we have gotta get this done eosstop endquote so harry set off into the heart of the forest with malfoy and fang eosstop they walked for nearly half an hour deeper and deeper into the forest until the path became almost impossible to follow because the trees were so thick eosstop harry thought the blood seemed to be getting thicker eosstop there were splashes on the roots of a tree as though the poor creature had been thrashing around in pain close by eosstop harry could see a clearing ahead through the tangled branches of an ancient oak eosstop look endquote he murmured holding out his arm to stop malfoy eosstop something bright white was gleaming on the ground eosstop they inched closer eosstop it was the unicorn all right and it was dead eosstop harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad eosstop its long slender legs were stuck out at odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearlywhite on the dark leaves eosstop harry had taken one step toward it when a slithering sound made him freeze where he stood eosstop a bush on the edge of the clearing quivered eosstop eosstop then out of the shadows a hooded figure came crawling across the ground like some stalking beast eosstop harry malfoy and fang stood transfixed eosstop the cloaked figure reached the unicorn lowered its head over the wound in the animal is side and began to drink its blood eosstop aaaaaaaaaargh eosexclamation endquote malfoy let out a terrible scream and bolted so did fang eosstop the hooded figure raised its head and looked right at harry unicorn blood was dribbling down its front eosstop it got to its feet and came swiftly toward harry he could not move for fear eosstop then a pain like he would never felt before pierced his head it was as though his scar were on fire eosstop half blinded he staggered backward eosstop he heard hooves behind him galloping and something jumped clean over harry charging at the figure eosstop the pain in harry is head was so bad he fell to his knees eosstop it took a minute or two to pass eosstop when he looked up the figure had gone eosstop a centaur was standing over him not ronan or bane this one looked younger he had whiteblond hair and a palomino body eosstop are you all right eosquestion endquote said the centaur pulling harry to his feet eosstop yes thank you what was that eosquestion endquote the centaur did not answer eosstop he had astonishingly blue eyes like pale sapphires eosstop he looked carefully at harry his eyes lingering on the scar that stood out livid on harry is forehead eosstop you are the potter boy endquote he said eosstop startquote you had better get back to hagrid eosstop the forest is not safe at this time especially for you eosstop can you ride eosquestion it will be quicker this way eosstop my name is firenze endquote he added as he lowered himself on to his front legs so that harry could clamber onto his back eosstop there was suddenly a sound of more galloping from the other side of the clearing eosstop ronan and bane came bursting through the trees their flanks heaving and sweaty eosstop firenze eosexclamation endquote bane thundered eosstop startquote what are you doing eosquestion you have a human on your back eosexclamation have you no shame eosquestion are you a

voice eosstop bane kicked his back legs in anger eosstop for the best eosexclamation what is that to do with us eosquestion centaurs are concerned with what has been foretold eosexclamation it is not our business to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest eosexclamation endquote firenze suddenly reared on to his hind legs in anger so that harry had to grab his shoulders to stay on eosstop do you not see that unicorn eosquestion endquote firenze bellowed at bane eosstop startquote do you not understand why it was killed eosquestion or have the planets not let you in on that secret eosquestion i set myself against what is lurking in this forest bane yes with humans alongside me if i must eosstop endquote and firenze whisked around with harry clutching on as best he could they plunged off into the trees leaving ronan and bane behind them eosstop harry did not have a clue what was going on eosstop why is bane so angry eosquestion endquote he asked eosstop startquote what was that thing you saved me from anyway eosquestion endquote firenze slowed to a walk warned harry to keep his head bowed in case of lowhanging branches but did not answer harry is question eosstop they made their way through the trees in silence for so long that harry thought firenze did not want to talk to him anymore eosstop they were passing through a particularly dense patch of trees however when firenze suddenly stopped eosstop harry potter do you know what unicorn blood is used for eosquestion endquote no endquote said harry startled by the odd question eosstop startquote we have only used the horn and tail hair in potions eosstop endquote that is because it is a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn endquote said firenze eosstop startquote only one who has nothing to lose and everything to gain would commit such a crime eosstop the blood of a unicorn will keep you alive even if you are an inch from death but at a terrible price eosstop you have slain something pure and defenseless to save yourself and you will have but a halflife a cursed life from the moment the blood touches your lips eosstop endquote harry stared at the back of firenze is head which was dappled silver in the moonlight eosstop but who would be that desperate eosquestion endquote he wondered aloud eosstop startquote if you are going to be cursed forever deaths better is not it eosquestion endquote it is endquote firenze agreed startquote unless all you need is to stay alive long enough to drink something else something that will bring you back to full strength and power something that will mean you can never die eosstop mr eosstop potter do you know what is hidden in the school at this very moment eosquestion endquote the sorcerer is stone eosexclamation of course the elixir of life eosexclamation but i do not understand who endquote can you think of nobody who has waited many years to return to power who has clung to life awaiting their chance eosquestion endquote it was as though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around harry is heart eosstop over the rustling of the trees he seemed to hear once more what hagrid had told him on the night they had met startquote some say he died eosstop codswallop in my opinion eosstop dunno if he had enough human left in him to die eosstop endquote do you mean endquote harry croaked startquote that was vol endquote harry eosexclamation harry are you all right eosquestion endquote hermione was running toward them down the path hagrid puffing along behind her eosstop i am fine endquote said harry hardly knowing what he was saying eosstop startquote the unicorn is dead hagrid it is in that clearing back there eosstop endquote this is where i leave you endquote firenze murmured as hagrid hurried off to examine the unicorn eosstop startquote you are safe now eosstop endquote harry slid off his back eosstop good luck harry potter endquote said firenze eosstop startquote the planets have been read wrongly before now even by centaurs eosstop i hope this is one of those times eosstop endquote he turned and cantered back into the depths of the forest leaving harry shivering behind him eosstop ron had fallen asleep in the dark common room waiting for them to return eosstop he shouted something about quidditch fouls when harry roughly shook him awake eosstop in a matter of seconds though he was wideeyed as harry began to tell him and hermione what had happened in the forest eosstop harry could not sit down eosstop he paced up and down in front of the fire eosstop he was still shaking eosstop snape wants the stone for voldemort eosstop and voldemort is waiting in the forest eosstop and all this time we thought snape just wanted to get rich eosstop eosstop endquote stop saying the name eosexclamation endquote said ron in a terrified whisper as if he thought voldemort could hear them eosstop harry was not listening eosstop firenze saved me but he should not have done so eosstop eosstop bane was furious eosstop he was talking about interfering with what the planets say is going to happen eosstop eosstop they must show that voldemort is coming back eosstop eosstop bane thinks firenze should have let voldemort kill me eosstop eosstop i suppose that is written in the stars as well eosstop endquote will you stop saying the name eosexclamation endquote ron hissed eosstop so all i have got to wait for now is snape to steal the stone endquote harry went on feverishly startquote then voldemort will be able to come and finish me off eosstop well i suppose bane will be happy eosstop endquote hermione looked very frightened but she had a word of comfort eosstop harry everyone says dumbledore is the only one youknowwho was ever afraid of with dumbledore around youknowwho will not touch you eosstop anyway who says the centaurs are right eosquestion it sounds like fortunetelling to me and professor mcgonagall says that is a very imprecise branch of magic eosstop endquote the sky had turned light before they stopped talking eosstop they went to bed exhausted their throats sore eosstop but the night is surprises were not over eosstop when harry pulled back his sheets he found his invisibility cloak folded neatly underneath them eosstop there was a note pinned to it just in case eosstop chapter sixteen through the trapdoor in years to come harry would never quite remember how he had managed to get through his exams when he half expected voldemort to come bursting through the door at any moment eosstop yet the days crept by and there could be no doubt that fluffy was still

them all nervous breathing down their necks while they tried to remember how to make a forgetfulness potion eosstop harry did the best he could trying to ignore the stabbing pains in his forehead which had been bothering him ever since his trip into the forest eosstop neville thought harry had a bad case of exam nerves because harry could not sleep but the truth was that harry kept being woken by his old nightmare except that it was now worse than ever because there was a hooded figure dripping blood in it eosstop maybe it was because they had not seen what harry had seen in the forest or because they did not have scars burning on their foreheads but ron and hermione did not seem as worried about the stone as harry eosstop the idea of voldemort certainly scared them but he did not keep visiting them in dreams and they were so busy with their studying they did not have much time to fret about what snape or anyone else might be up to eosstop their very last exam was history of magic eosstop one hour of answering questions about batty old wizards who would invented selfstirring cauldrons and they would be free free for a whole wonderful week until their exam results came out eosstop when the ghost of professor binns told them to put down their quills and roll up their parchment harry could not help cheering with the rest eosstop that was far easier than i thought it would be endquote said hermione as they joined the crowds flocking out onto the sunny grounds eosstop startquote i need not have learned about the 1637 werewolf code of conduct or the uprising of elfric the eager eosstop endquote hermione always liked to go through their exam papers afterward but ron said this made him feel ill so they wandered down to the lake and flopped under a tree eosstop the weasley twins and lee jordan were tickling the tentacles of a giant squid which was basking in the warm shallows eosstop startquote no more studying endquote ron sighed happily stretching out on the grass eosstop startquote you could look more cheerful harry we have got a week before we find out how badly we have done there is no need to worry yet eosstop endquote harry was rubbing his forehead

madam pomfrey endquote hermione suggested eosstop i am not ill endquote said harry eosstop startquote i think it is a warning eosstop it means danger is coming eosstop eosstop endquote ron could not get worked up it was too hot eosstop harry relax hermione is right the stone is safe as long as dumbledore is around eosstop anyway we have never had any proof snape found out how to get past fluffy eosstop he nearly had his leg ripped off once he is not going to try it again in a hurry eosstop and neville will play quidditch for england before hagrid lets dumbledore down eosstop endquote harry nodded but he could not shake off a lurking feeling that there was something he would forgotten to do something important eosstop when he tried to explain this hermione said startquote that is just the exams eosstop i woke up last night and was halfway through my transfiguration notes before i remembered we would done that one eosstop endquote harry was quite sure the unsettled feeling did not have anything to do with work though eosstop he watched an owl flutter toward the school across the bright blue sky a note clamped in its mouth eosstop hagrid was the only one who ever sent him letters eosstop hagrid would never betray dumbledore eosstop hagrid would never tell anyone how to get past fluffy eosstop never eosstop but harry suddenly jumped to his feet eosstop where are you

endquote said harry eosstop startquote well here goes eosstop endquote he put hagrid is flute to his lips and blew eosstop it was not really a tune but from the first note the beast is eyes began to

warned harry as they slipped out of the cloak and crept toward the trapdoor eosstop they could feel the dog is hot smelly breath as they approached the giant heads eosstop startquote i think we will be able to pull the door open endquote said ron peering over the dog is back eosstop startquote want to go first hermione eosquestion endquote no i do not eosexclamation endquote all right eosstop endquote ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over the dog is legs eosstop he bent and pulled the ring of the trapdoor which swung up and open eosstop what can you see eosquestion endquote hermione said anxiously eosstop nothing just black there is no way of climbing down we will just have to drop eosstop endquote harry who was still playing the flute waved at ron to get his attention and pointed at himself eosstop you want to go first eosquestion are you sure eosquestion endquote said ron eosstop startquote i do not know how deep this thing goes eosstop give the flute to hermione so she can keep him asleep eosstop endquote harry handed the flute over eosstop in the few seconds silence the dog growled and twitched but the moment hermione began to play it fell back into its deep sleep eosstop harry climbed over it and looked down through the trapdoor eosstop there was no sign of the bottom eosstop he lowered himself through the hole until he was hanging on by his fingertips eosstop then he looked up at ron and said startquote if anything happens to me do not follow eosstop go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore right eosquestion endquote right endquote said ron eosstop see you in a minute i hope eosstop and harry let go eosstop cold damp air rushed past him as he fell down down down and flump eosstop with a funny muffled sort of thump he landed on something soft eosstop he sat up and felt around his eyes not used to the gloom eosstop it felt as though he was sitting on some sort of plant eosstop it is okay eosexclamation endquote he called up to the light the size of a postage stamp which was the open trapdoor startquote it is a soft landing you can jump eosexclamation endquote ron followed right away eosstop he landed sprawled next to harry eosstop what is this stuff eosquestion endquote were his first words eosstop dunno some sort of plant thing eosstop i suppose it is here to break the fall eosstop come on hermione eosexclamation endquote the distant music stopped eosstop there was a loud bark from the dog but hermione had already jumped eosstop she landed on harry is other side eosstop we must be miles under the school she said eosstop lucky this plant thing is here really endquote said ron eosstop lucky eosexclamation endquote shrieked hermione eosstop startquote look at you both eosexclamation endquote she leapt up and struggled toward a damp wall eosstop she had to struggle because the moment she had landed the plant had started to twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles eosstop as for harry and ron their legs had already been bound tightly in long creepers without their noticing eosstop hermione had managed to free herself before the plant got a firm grip on her eosstop now she watched in horror as the two boys fought to pull the plant off them but the more they strained against it the tighter and faster the plant wound around them eosstop stop moving eosexclamation endquote hermione ordered them eosstop startquote i know what this is it is devil is snare eosexclamation endquote oh i am so glad we know what it is called that is a great help endquote snarled ron leaning back trying to stop the plant from curling around his neck eosstop startquote shut up i am trying to remember how to kill it eosexclamation endquote said hermione eosstop well hurry up i can not breathe eosexclamation endquote harry gasped wrestling with it as it curled around his chest eosstop devil is snare devil is snare eosstop what did professor sprout say eosquestion it likes the dark and the damp startquote so light a fire eosexclamation endquote harry choked eosstop yes of course but there is no wood eosexclamation endquote hermione cried wringing her hands eosstop have you gone mad eosquestion endquote ron bellowed eosstop startquote are you a witch or not eosquestion endquote oh right eosexclamation endquote said hermione and she whipped out her wand waved it muttered something and sent a jet of the same bluebell flames she had used on snape at the plant eosstop in a matter of seconds the two boys felt it loosening its grip as it cringed away from the light and warmth eosstop wriggling and flailing it unraveled itself from their bodies and they were able to pull free eosstop lucky you pay attention in herbology hermione endquote said harry as he joined her by the wall wiping sweat off his face eosstop yeah endquote said ron startquote and lucky harry does not lose his head in a crisis nothere is no wood honestly eosstop endquote this way endquote said harry pointing down a stone passageway which was the only way forward eosstop all they could hear apart from their footsteps was the gentle drip of water trickling down the walls eosstop the passageway sloped downward and harry was reminded of gringotts eosstop with an unpleasant jolt of the heart he remembered the dragons said to be guarding vaults in the wizards bank eosstop if they met a dragon a fullygrown dragon norbert had been bad enough eosstop can you hear something eosquestion endquote ron whispered eosstop harry listened eosstop a soft rustling and clinking seemed to be coming from up ahead eosstop do you think it is a ghost eosquestion endquote i do not know eosstop sounds like wings to me eosstop endquote there is light ahead i can see something moving eosstop endquote they reached the end of the passageway and saw before them a brilliantly lit chamber its ceiling arching high above them eosstop it was full of small jewelbright birds fluttering and tumbling all around the room eosstop on the opposite side of the chamber was a heavy wooden door eosstop do you think they will attack us if we cross the room eosquestion endquote said ron eosstop probably endquote said harry eosstop startquote they do not look very vicious but i suppose if they all swooped down at once eosstop well there is no other choice eosstop i will run eosstop endquote he took a deep breath covered his face with his arms and sprinted across the room eosstop he expected to feel sharp beaks and claws tearing at him any second but nothing happened eosstop he reached the door untouched eosstop he pulled the handle but it was locked eosstop the other two followed him eosstop they tugged and heaved at the door but it would not budge not even when hermione tried her alohomora charm eosstop now what eosquestion endquote said ron eosstop these birds eosstop they can not be here just for decoration endquote said hermione eosstop they watched the birds soaring overhead glittering glittering eosquestion startquote they are not birds eosexclamation endquote harry said suddenly eosstop startquote they are keys eosexclamation winged keys look carefully eosstop so that must mean eosstop endquote he looked around the chamber while the other two squinted up at the flock of keys eosstop startquote eosstop yes look eosexclamation broomsticks eosexclamation we have got to catch the key to the door eosexclamation endquote but there are hundreds of them eosexclamation endquote ron examined the lock on the door eosstop we are looking for a big oldfashioned one probably silver like the handle eosstop endquote they each seized a broomstick and kicked off into the air soaring into the midst of the cloud of keys eosstop they grabbed and snatched but the bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible to catch one eosstop not for nothing though was harry the youngest seeker in a century eosstop he had a knack for spotting things other people did not eosstop after a minute is weaving about through the whirl of rainbow feathers he noticed a large silver key that had a bent wing as if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly into the keyhole eosstop that one eosexclamation endquote he called to the others eosstop startquote that big one there no there with bright blue wings the feathers are all crumpled on one side eosstop endquote ron went speeding in the direction that harry was pointing crashed into the ceiling and nearly fell off his broom eosstop we have got to close in on it eosexclamation endquote harry called not taking his eyes off the key with the damaged wing eosstop startquote ron you come at it from above hermione stay below and stop it from going down and i will try and catch it eosstop right now eosexclamation endquote ron dived hermione rocketed upward the key dodged them both and harry streaked after it it sped toward the wall harry leaned forward and with a nasty crunching noise pinned it against the stone with one hand eosstop ron and hermione is cheers echoed around the high chamber eosstop they landed quickly and harry ran to the door the key struggling in his hand eosstop he rammed it into the lock and turned it worked eosstop the moment the lock had clicked open the key took flight again looking very battered now that it had been caught twice eosstop ready eosquestion endquote harry asked the other two his hand on the door handle eosstop they nodded eosstop he pulled the door open eosstop the next chamber was so dark they could not see anything at all eosstop but as they stepped into it light suddenly flooded the room to reveal an astonishing sight eosstop they were standing on the edge of a huge chessboard behind the black chessmen which were all taller than they were and carved from what looked like black stone eosstop facing them way across the chamber were the white pieces eosstop harry ron and hermione shivered slightly the towering white chessmen had no faces eosstop now what do we do eosquestion endquote harry whispered eosstop it is obvious is not it eosquestion endquote said ron eosstop startquote we have got to play our way across the room eosstop endquote behind the white pieces they could see another door eosstop how eosquestion endquote said hermione nervously eosstop i think endquote said ron startquote we are going to have to be chessmen eosstop endquote he walked up to a black knight and put his hand out to touch the knight is horse eosstop at once the stone sprang to life eosstop the horse pawed the ground and the knight turned his helmeted head to look down at ron eosstop do we er have to join you to get across eosquestion endquote the black knight nodded eosstop ron turned to the other two eosstop this needs thinking about he said eosstop i suppose we have got to take the place of three of the black pieces eosstop eosstop endquote harry and hermione stayed quiet watching ron think eosstop finally he said startquote now do not be offended or anything but neither of you are that good at chess endquote we are not offended endquote said harry quickly eosstop startquote just tell us what to do eosstop endquote well harry you take the place of that bishop and hermione you 90 next to him instead of that castle eosstop endquote what about you eosquestion endquote i am going to be a knight endquote said ron eosstop the chessmen seemed to have been listening because at these words a knight a bishop and a castle turned their backs on the white pieces and walked off the board leaving three empty squares that harry ron and hermione took eosstop white always plays first in chess endquote said ron peering across the board eosstop yes eosstop look eosstop endquote a white pawn had moved forward two squares eosstop ron started to direct the black pieces eosstop they moved silently wherever he sent them eosstop harry is knees were trembling eosstop what if they lost eosquestion startquote harry move diagonally four squares to the right eosstop endquote their first real shock came when their other knight was taken eosstop the white queen smashed him to the floor and dragged him off the board where he lay quite still facedown eosstop had to let that happen endquote said ron looking shaken eosstop startquote leaves you free to take that bishop hermione go on eosstop endquote every time one of their men was lost the white pieces showed no mercy eosstop soon there was a huddle of limp black players slumped along the wall eosstop twice ron only just noticed in time that harry and hermione were in danger eosstop he himself darted around the board taking almost as many white pieces as they had lost black ones eosstop we are nearly there endquote he muttered suddenly eosstop startquote let me think let me think eosstop endquote the white queen turned her blank face toward him eosstop yes eosstop endquote said ron softly startquote it is the only way eosstop i have got to be taken eosstop endquote nof harry and hermione shouted eosstop that is chess eosexclamation endquote snapped ron eosstop startquote you have got to make some sacrifices eosexclamation i take one step forward and she will take me that leaves you free to checkmate the king harry eosexclamation endquote but endquote do you want to stop snape or not eosquestion endquote ron endquote look if you do not hurry up he will already have the stone eosexclamation endquote there was no alternative eosstop ready eosquestion endquote ron called his face pale but determined eosstop startquote here i go now do not hang around once you have won eosstop endquote he stepped forward and the white queen pounced eosstop she struck ron hard across the head with her stone arm and he crashed to the floor hermione screamed but stayed on her square the white queen dragged ron to one side eosstop he looked as if he would been knocked out eosstop shaking harry moved three spaces to the left eosstop the white king took off his crown and threw it at harry is feet eosstop they had won eosstop the chessmen parted and bowed leaving the door ahead clear eosstop with one last desperate look back at ron harry and hermione charged through the door and up the next passageway eosstop what if he is eosquestion endquote he will be all right endquote said harry trying to convince himself eosstop startquote what do you reckon is next eosquestion endquote we have had sprout is that was the devil is snare flitwick must have put charms on the keys mcgonagall transfigured the chessmen to make them alive that leaves quirrell is spell and snape is eosstop endquote they had reached another door eosstop all right eosquestion endquote harry whispered eosstop go on eosstop endquote harry pushed it open eosstop a disgusting smell filled their nostrils making both of them pull their robes up over their noses eosstop eyes watering they saw flat on the floor in front of them a troll even larger than the one they had tackled out cold with a bloody lump on its head eosstop i am glad we did not have to fight that one endquote harry whispered as they stepped carefully over one of its massive legs eosstop startquote come on i can not breathe eosstop endquote he pulled open the next door both of them hardly daring to look at what came next but there was nothing very frightening in here just a table with seven differently shaped bottles standing on it in a line eosstop snape is endquote said harry eosstop startquote what do we have to do eosquestion endquote they stepped over the threshold and immediately a fire sprang up behind them in the doorway eosstop it was not ordinary fire either it was purple eosstop at the same instant black flames shot up in the doorway leading onward eosstop they were trapped eosstop look eosexclamation endquote hermione seized a roll of paper lying next to the bottles eosstop harry looked over her shoulder to read it danger lies before you while safety lies behind two of us will help you which ever you would find one among us seven will let you move ahead another will transport the drinker back instead two among our number hold only nettle wine three of us are killers waiting bidden in line eosstop choose unless you wish to stay here forevermore to help you in your choice we give you these clues four first however slyly the poison tries to hide you will always find some on nettle wine is left side second different are those who stand at either end but if you would move onward neither is your friend third as you see clearly all are different size neither dwarf nor giant holds death in their insides fourth the second left and the second on the right are twins once you taste them though different at first sight eosstop hermione let out a great sigh and harry amazed saw that she was smiling the very last thing he felt like doing eosstop brilliant endquote said hermione eosstop startquote this is not magic it is logic a puzzle eosstop a lot of the greatest wizards have not got an ounce of logic they would be stuck in here forever eosstop endquote but so will we will not we eosquestion endquote startquote of course not endquote said hermione eosstop startquote everything we need is here on this paper eosstop seven bottles three are poison two are wine one will get us safely through the black fire and one will get us back through the purple eosstop endquote but how do we know which to drink eosquestion endquote give me a minute eosstop endquote hermione read the paper several times eosstop then she walked up and down the line of bottles muttering to herself and pointing at them eosstop at last she clapped her hands eosstop got it endquote she said eosstop startquote the smallest bottle will get us through the black fire toward the stone eosstop endquote harry looked at the tiny bottle eosstop there is only enough there for one of us endquote he said eosstop startquote that is hardly one swallow eosstop endquote they looked at each other eosstop which one will get you back through the purple flames eosquestion endquote hermione pointed at a rounded bottle at the right end of the line eosstop you drink that endquote said harry eosstop startquote no listen get back and get ron eosstop grab brooms from the flying key room they will get you out of the trapdoor and past fluffy go straight to the owlery and send hedwig to dumbledore we need him eosstop i might be able to hold snape off for a while but i am no match for him really eosstop endquote but harry what if youknowwho is with him eosquestion endquote well i was lucky once was not i eosquestion endquote said harry pointing at his scar eosstop i might get lucky again eosstop endquote hermione is lip trembled and she suddenly dashed at harry and threw her arms around him eosstop

care eosstop endquote go eosexclamation endquote hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire eosstop harry took a deep breath and picked up the smallest bottle eosstop he turned to face the black flames eosstop here i come endquote he said and he drained the little bottle in one gulp eosstop it was indeed as though ice was flooding his body eosstop he put the bottle down and walked forward he braced himself saw the black flames licking his body but could not feel them for a moment he could see nothing but dark fire then he was on the other side in the last chamber eosstop there was already someone there but it was not snape eosstop it was not even voldemort eosstop chapter seventeen the man with two faces it was quirrell eosstop you eosexclamation endquote gasped harry eosstop quirrell smiled eosstop his face was not twitching at all eosstop me endquote he said calmly eosstop startquote i wondered whether i would be meeting you here potter eosstop endquote but i thought snape endquote severus eosquestion endquote quirrell laughed and it was not his usual quivering treble either but cold and sharp eosstop startquote yes severus does seem the type does not he

eosquestion endquote certainly eosstop i have a special gift with trolls you must have seen what i did to the one in the chamber back there eosquestion unfortunately while everyone else was running

bite snape is leg off properly eosstop now wait quietly potter eosstop i need to examine this interesting mirror eosstop it was only then that harry realized what was standing behind quirrell eosstop it was the mirror of erised eosstop this mirror is the key to finding the stone endquote quirrell murmured tapping his way around the frame eosstop startquote trust dumbledore to come up with something like this eosstop but he is in london eosstop i will be far away by the time he gets back eosstop eosstop endquote all harry could think of doing was to keep quirrell talking and stop him from concentrating on the mirror eosstop i saw you and snape in the forest endquote he blurted out eosstop yes endquote said quirrell idly walking around the mirror to look at the back eosstop
